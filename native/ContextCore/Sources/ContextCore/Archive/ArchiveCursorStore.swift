//  Story 262: the delta stamp per stream, in the app's database. A Health stream's cursor is its query anchor
//  (what Health has already answered, deletions included); the trail's is the last row id sent. Set only after
//  the Cockpit answered 2xx for the page it covers (ArchiveUploader), so a lost answer sends the page again and
//  the archive, keyed by guid, takes nothing twice.
