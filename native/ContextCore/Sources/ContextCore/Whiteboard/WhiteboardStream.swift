//  Claude's answer as it arrives (spec 2026-11-01-whiteboard-shapes-design.md, stories 370, 373–375): the Cockpit's
//  `POST /whiteboard/suggest` streams one stroke per line and a last `{"done": true, "ms": …}`, or
//  `{"error": …, "ms": …}` in its place when the model fails, when asked for NDJSON (cockpit#85), and a Cockpit that
//  doesn't still answers with one JSON. The caller reads the body a byte at a time.
