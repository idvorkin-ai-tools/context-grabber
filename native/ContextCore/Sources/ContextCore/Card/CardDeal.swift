// The memdeck card (story 129): the old app's deal, unchanged, so the card screen and any widget deal alike.
// Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-widget-random-card-design.md
//
// The card is a function of two things and nothing else: the clock, and how many times the card has been tapped.
// Every five minutes has one card; each run of 52 of them is one shuffled deck, so no card repeats inside a run and
// every card comes up once per run; where two runs meet, a would-be repeat swaps with its neighbour. A tap bumps the
// number until the card in hand changes, and the clock deals on from there.
