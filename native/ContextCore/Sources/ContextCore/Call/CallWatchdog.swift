//  The call's liveness rules, with no platform in them (#95).
//
//  Igor's dumps of 2026-08-30 showed the audio session coming up with one direction dead, either way round: a
//  mic tap that delivered one buffer and then nothing after a route change; a socket that delivered 15 frames of
//  Larry in 63 s; a greeting played into an output whose clock had not started. Each has a plain signal — "no
//  buffer for a while", "the clock is not advancing", "text is arriving but audio is not" — and a plain cure. The
//  rules live here so the host can test them; the app's audio layer and CallSession apply them.
