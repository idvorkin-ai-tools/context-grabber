//  A Larry call: the socket, the microphone, the speaker and the captions, with no platform in it, so the whole
//  thing runs under a fake socket, a fake audio layer and a fake clock on the Mac.
//
//    idle ─start→ connecting ─ready→ live ─(stop | closed | drop)→ ended ─start→ …
//
//  The bridge decides everything about the conversation. This class decides only: when the mic opens (on
//  `ready`, not before), what leaves the phone (nothing while muted), when playback is cut (on `interrupted`), how
//  a dead microphone is healed, and how the call is reported to have ended. Every boundary is a `call_*` event in
//  the session log (docs/DEBUGGING.md).
//
//  Main thread only: the app hops socket messages, mic buffers and audio callbacks onto the main queue before
//  calling in, and the fakes call straight through.
//
//  Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md; the native differences are under step 3
//  of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md. Port of lib/callSession.ts.
