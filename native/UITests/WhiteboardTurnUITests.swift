//  Stories 344, 345, 349, 357, 360, 371, 380–389 on the simulator, against the fake Cockpit (scripts/native/test-whiteboard-ui.sh
//  starts it), on a board on paper (the only canvas since 2026-11-07): a stroke and a pause bring Claude's ghost through a
//  streamed answer, words spoken on an empty board bring one with no stroke, and Larry's turn hands him the board and his
//  marks arrive by themselves beside Claude's. A finger draws on the simulator; the Pencil is the iPad's check. What paper
//  shows (its ghosts, taps, lines and colours, by pixels) is `WhiteboardPaperGhostsUITests`' and
//  `WhiteboardPaperLinesUITests`'. The turn's rules (Claude's fade, the count climbing, a Cockpit that doesn't stream, Ghosts
//  off for strokes and for words, stale answers, spoken words held, a tap's keep or dismiss) are `WhiteboardGhostTurnsTests`,
//  on the host.
