//  Stories 390–393, 638 and 639 on the simulator, on paper, against the fake Cockpit (scripts/native/test-whiteboard-ui.sh starts it),
//  read from the Send button's label (the strokes drawn). HI is two strokes, one a letter. The text's layout, its caps, a
//  stroke a letter and what the bar says are `WhiteboardPasteTests`, on the host; these are the keys, the canvas and the
//  bar. XCUITest's taps never reach the system's paste button, so the button is the iPad's check and these go through
//  ⌘V or GRABBER_WHITEBOARD_PASTE. What a page adds to a paste is `WhiteboardPaperPasteUITests`.
