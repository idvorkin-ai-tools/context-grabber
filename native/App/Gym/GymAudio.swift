//  The Gym Timer's audio: the session, the background keepalive and the cues (stories 104, 105, 107).
//
//  The session is `playback` mixed with others, so a workout never pauses the music. Around each cue the duck
//  window (ContextCore's DuckWindow) adds `duckOthers` + `interruptSpokenAudioAndMixWithOthers` to the live
//  session, then lets go with a deactivate-and-reactivate: a paused podcast resumes only on deactivation, and
//  only when told (`notifyOthersOnDeactivation`). The keepalive is a looping second of -66 dB noise — real
//  samples, which iOS counts as live output — so the app keeps running, and speaking, with the screen locked.
//  The cues are sound files, never synthesis, in the chosen count voice (stories 182, 187): Adam, Igor's own clone
//  (scripts/make-timer-words.sh) or an Australian woman (scripts/make-timer-voice.sh).
//
//  Everything runs in order on one queue: a session call can block for a moment and must not stall the face.
