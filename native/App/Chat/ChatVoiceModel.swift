//  Speaking a message in Chat (#448, chat spec "Speaking a message", story 303): the thread's mic is BugKit's
//  NoteDictation, the problem report's Apple dictation (Igor, 2026-10-26: "All right, use that."). The words stream
//  into that thread's bar as he speaks, after what was typed, never sent. A live call owns the microphone: the button
//  stands down, and a call that starts mid-recording stops it. A recording stops itself at ChatVoice.limit.
