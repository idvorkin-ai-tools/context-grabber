//  The simulator cannot be shaken or tapped from a script, so the app reads launch hooks from the environment
//  (`SIMCTL_CHILD_<name>` through simctl); docs/TESTING.md lists them. ContextCore's `LaunchHooks` reads them (its
//  host tests cover every grammar); this runs them, each feature's in its own directory (#796), so a change to one
//  feature's hook is that feature's change.
