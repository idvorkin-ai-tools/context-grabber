# From the home screen: widgets, the card, and links

Getting to the thing without opening the app: the Today widget, the memdeck card on the home and lock screens, links that land where I mean, and the Shortcuts app.

Part of the [user stories](README.md); persona and format are described there.

---

### User Story 120:

- **Summary:** Today's numbers on the home screen without opening the app
- **Status:** implemented in [b789147](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b789147), [dd1a899](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/dd1a899); verified on the phone (daily)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** at the kitchen counter glancing at the phone
- **I want to** see today's steps, sleep and exercise minutes on a home-screen widget
- **so that** "am I on track" costs a glance, not a launch

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** After a grab
- **Given:** the medium Today widget is on the home screen
- **When:** I press Grab Context in the app and return to the home screen
- **Then:** within two minutes the widget shows "Today · <weekday>" with steps, sleep hours and exercise minutes from that grab (an em-dash for anything never grabbed), and tapping the top block opens the app on the dashboard

---

### User Story 121:

- **Summary:** Start a timer from the home screen in one tap
- **Status:** implemented in [a5ff68d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a5ff68d), [b789147](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b789147), [83e2bdc](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/83e2bdc), [2ef4a17](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2ef4a17); verified by `deepLink.test.ts` and on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** lifter with the bell already in hand
- **I want to** tap 1 MIN, 2 MIN or 5-1 on the widget
- **so that** the timer is counting down before I have opened, navigated or pressed START

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The 1 MIN tile
- **Given:** the Today widget is on the home screen and the app is closed
- **When:** I tap the 1 MIN tile
- **Then:** the app opens on the Gym Timer with the 1 MIN preset selected and the countdown running within about a second — the same when the app was already open on another tab

---

### User Story 122:

- **Summary:** Bump the day's tally from the widget without launching the app
- **Status:** implemented in [d00e45b](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d00e45b), [c6fc609](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c6fc609); verified by `counter.test.ts` and on the phone
- **Issues:** [#29](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/29) — the counter half shipped; the quick 5-minute meditation preset asked for there is still open

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man doing a set of squats between meetings
- **I want to** tap +1 on the widget after each one
- **so that** "I did a thing" is one tap and today's count is on the Move tab when I look

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** +1 in place
- **Given:** the Today widget shows the tally row with its count
- **When:** I tap +1 on the widget
- **Then:** the count on the widget rises by one without the app opening, the Move tab's tally marks show the same number, and at local midnight the count starts again from zero

---

### User Story 123:

- **Summary:** Reflect from the widget: affirm, be grateful, or open the journal
- **Status:** implemented in [d61f15a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d61f15a), [2e4fd9f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2e4fd9f); verified by `deepLink.test.ts` and on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man who just noticed something worth writing down
- **I want to** tap 🎯 Affirm or 🙏 Grateful on the widget and land straight on that card
- **so that** the noticing is not lost to the four taps it would take to get there

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Straight to the card
- **Given:** the widget's Reflect strip shows today's counts ("☀️2  ✓1  🙏4") and the three tiles
- **When:** I tap 🙏 Grateful
- **Then:** the app opens with the Grateful card already up, and after I save, the widget's gratitude count reads one more on its next refresh

---

### User Story 124:

- **Summary:** Call Larry from the widget's ☎ pill
- **Status:** implemented in [8d35bb6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8d35bb6); verified on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man with a thought for Larry and the phone on the counter
- **I want to** tap the ☎ Call pill on the widget
- **so that** the call is connecting before the thought is gone

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** One tap to a call
- **Given:** the Today widget is on the home screen
- **When:** I tap ☎ Call
- **Then:** the app opens on the Call tab already *connecting…* on the remembered backend, and if a call is already live it simply shows that call

---

### User Story 125:

- **Summary:** Tap the Live Activity and land on the timer
- **Status:** implemented in [a5ff68d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a5ff68d); verified on the phone; native app: [ea8c689](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/ea8c689), by construction rather than a link — the card lives only while the timer's full screen is up (RESET and leaving end it, a killed launch's card is ended at the next launch), so opening the app is opening the timer; verified by reading the code only, the tap not yet on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** lifter watching the countdown in the Dynamic Island
- **I want to** tap it and be on the Gym Timer screen
- **so that** pause, reset and the phase are one tap away, not the dashboard

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** From the island to the timer
- **Given:** a rounds timer is running and the Live Activity shows the countdown
- **When:** I tap the Live Activity
- **Then:** the app opens on the Gym Timer in rounds mode with the timer still running, not on the dashboard

---

### User Story 126:

- **Summary:** A link opens the app exactly where I meant, from anywhere
- **Status:** implemented in [a5ff68d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a5ff68d), [b789147](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b789147), [cef19fc](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cef19fc), [a902080](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a902080), [c81b9b1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c81b9b1); verified by `deepLink.test.ts` and on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man wiring the Action Button and a few Shortcuts
- **I want to** open `grabber://timer?preset=1min&autostart=1`, `grabber://grab`, `grabber://reflect/grateful`, `grabber://call?via=eleven`, `grabber://cockpit` or `grabber://card` and have each do the obvious thing
- **so that** every surface that can open a URL can drive the app, and a typo never crashes it

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Routes, cold and warm
- **Given:** the app is closed (and again with it open on the Today tab)
- **When:** I open `grabber://timer?preset=1min&autostart=1`
- **Then:** the timer starts within a second either way; `com.idvorkin.contextgrabber://` behaves identically; an unknown preset falls back to the last one; and a malformed link opens the dashboard with no error

---

### User Story 127:

- **Summary:** Always a playing card on the big widget, and a fresh one when I want it
- **Status:** implemented in [c81b9b1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c81b9b1); verified by `just check-deal` (the deal's promises under plain `swiftc`) and on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** memdeck student who keeps the large widget on two home-screen pages
- **I want to** see a random card beside today's numbers, changing every five minutes, and a different one the instant I tap it
- **so that** every glance is a prompt to find the card in the stack

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The card deals
- **Given:** the large Today widget is on both home-screen pages
- **When:** I tap the card on one of them
- **Then:** within a second it is a different card on both pages and the lock screen, the app does not open, it is never the same card twice in a row, and left alone for a quarter hour it has changed more than once on its own

---

### User Story 128:

- **Summary:** The same card on the lock screen, and a tap that takes me to it
- **Status:** implemented in [c81b9b1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c81b9b1); verified on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** glancing at the locked phone
- **I want to** see "7♣ memdeck" under the clock, and land on a big card if I tap it
- **so that** the prompt is there before I unlock, and the practice is one tap further

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The lock-screen widget
- **Given:** the rectangular, round or inline memdeck widget is on the lock screen
- **When:** I tap it
- **Then:** it showed the same card as the big widget, was never blank, and the app opens on the Card tab with a big card that differs from the one the lock screen showed

---

### User Story 129:

- **Summary:** The Card tab: tap for another, or "think of a card" and wait five seconds
- **Issues:** [#219](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/219)
- **Status:** implemented in [c81b9b1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c81b9b1); verified by `CardScreen.test.tsx` and on the phone; native app (#219, Igor 2026-10-08: *"let's do it inline"*): implemented in [fdec37f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/fdec37f); verified by `CardDealTests` (host: the deal's promises, and the same card as the old app for the same moment) and `CardUITests` on the simulator (the home row opens face down counting, a card face up at zero, a tap deals another, *Never mind* keeps the card); replaced the same day by the trainer's own screen, story 245

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man about to do the trick for someone
- **I want to** press *Think of a card*, see the card turn face down with a count from five, and get a new card face up when it hits zero
- **so that** the pause is me saying "think of a card" and shuffling, and the reveal is theirs

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Think of a card
- **Given:** the Card tab is open on a fresh card (every open deals one; a tap deals another)
- **When:** I press *Think of a card*
- **Then:** the card goes face down counting five, four, three…, a new card is face up at zero, pressing *Never mind* mid-count stops it with the previous card face up, and on leaving the tab or locking the phone the widgets show the last card the tab dealt

---

### User Story 133:

- **Summary:** Think of a card in Grabber Native opens Igor's trainer
- **Status:** replaced by story 129 in the app (#219, Igor 2026-10-08: *"I don't think it's worthy of its own app"*); was [0152b68](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/0152b68)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man about to do the trick, with Grabber Native open
- **I want to** tap *Think of a card* and be in Think a Card Trainer with the beat already started
- **so that** I practise with the trainer I built for it, not a second card app

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The row
- **Given:** Think a Card Trainer is installed on the phone
- **When:** I tap *Think of a card* on Grabber Native's home screen
- **Then:** the trainer comes to the front and starts "think of a card" as its watch complication's tap does, and if the trainer is not installed the home screen says so instead

---

### User Story 130:

- **Summary:** "Call Larry" and "Open Cockpit" by name in the Shortcuts app and to Siri
- **Status:** implemented in [8d35bb6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8d35bb6), [a902080](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a902080); verified on the phone
- **Issues:** [#75](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/75), [#85](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/85) (closed)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man building an automation without wanting to remember a URL
- **I want to** pick *Call Larry* (with an optional backend) or *Open Cockpit* from Context Grabber's actions, or say "Call Larry in Context Grabber"
- **so that** the call and the dashboard are things I choose from a menu or speak, next to *Increment Counter*

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A shortcut of one action
- **Given:** the Shortcuts app lists *Call Larry* (Backend: Gemini, ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Drill, or blank) and *Open Cockpit* under Context Grabber
- **When:** I run a shortcut of just *Call Larry* with ElevenLabs while the app is closed
- **Then:** the app opens on the Call tab and goes *connecting… ElevenLabs* → *live* with no tap; run while a call is live it shows that call without restarting it; and *Open Cockpit* opens the Cockpit tab the same way

---

### User Story 131:

- **Summary:** Know which build is actually running on the phone
- **Status:** implemented in [bafc357](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/bafc357), [8b28d51](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8b28d51), [0bb87bf](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/0bb87bf); verified on the phone (every OTA)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man who just got told "an update is live" in a session
- **I want to** open About and read the commit message, short sha, branch and update id that are running
- **so that** "did the OTA land" is answered without a Mac

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** After an OTA
- **Given:** an update was published and the app has been opened twice since
- **When:** I open About
- **Then:** the Build Info shows the new commit's message and sha, the update channel, runtime version and update id, and *Check for update* reports what it did

---

### User Story 132:

- **Summary:** Today's path on a home-screen map widget
- **Status:** not implemented; asks: [#45](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/45), [#42](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/42) (which interpretation is still open)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** wondering where the day went before opening anything
- **I want to** see today's GPS trail drawn on a small map on the home screen
- **so that** the day's shape is a glance, like the steps are

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The map widget
- **Given:** background tracking has recorded today's trail
- **When:** I look at the home screen
- **Then:** a map widget shows today's route over the map with the current position marked, refreshed with the last grab


---

### User Story 134:

- **Summary:** Open Exercise Analyzer from the native home screen
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [225d739](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/225d739); verified by `ExerciseAnalyzerLinkUITests` on the simulator with Exercise Analyzer's url-scheme build installed (tap the row, Exercise Analyzer runs in front); the phone still to be checked by Igor
- **Issues:** [#142](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/142)
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Exercise Analyzer, one tap away](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#exercise-analyzer-one-tap-away)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** lifter whose home screen is Grabber Native
- **I want to** open Exercise Analyzer from it
- **so that** recording a set is one tap from where I already am

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The row
- **Given:** Exercise Analyzer is installed
- **When:** I tap *Exercise Analyzer* on Grabber Native's home screen
- **Then:** Exercise Analyzer comes to the front, the session log has `open_exercise_analyzer` with ok true, and without it installed the home screen says it is not installed

---

### User Story 243:

- **Summary:** Workout Supermix from the native home screen
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [fae3e8c](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/fae3e8c); verified by `WorkoutSupermixUITests` on the simulator (tap the row, Shortcuts runs in front; the simulator has no such shortcut); YouTube Music playing the mix on the phone not yet; superseded by story 139 (#372): the tile opens the mix's link directly, not the shortcut
- **Issues:** [#220](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/220)
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Workout Supermix, one tap away](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#workout-supermix-one-tap-away)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** lifter about to start a workout from Grabber Native
- **I want to** tap one row and have my YouTube Music Workout Supermix playing
- **so that** the music starts without hunting through YouTube Music

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The row
- **Given:** my *Play Workout Supermix* shortcut is in the Shortcuts app
- **When:** I tap *Workout Supermix* on Grabber Native's home screen
- **Then:** Shortcuts runs the shortcut and YouTube Music plays the mix, the session log has `open_workout_supermix` with ok true, and without Shortcuts on the phone the home screen says so

---

### User Story 139:

- **Summary:** Workout Supermix opens straight in YouTube Music
- **Issues:** [#372](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/372)
- **Status:** implemented in [fe5b5d4](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/fe5b5d4) (the tile opens Igor's link as a universal link, the browser without YouTube Music, and the log says which); verified by `just test` (host) and a parse; `WorkoutSupermixUITests` (Safari in front on the simulator) and the build in the next build turn; YouTube Music opening on the phone still for Igor
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Workout Supermix, one tap away](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#workout-supermix-one-tap-away)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** lifter about to start a workout from Grabber Native
- **I want to** tap the Workout Supermix tile and land in my mix in YouTube Music
- **so that** the music starts without the Shortcuts app flashing in front first

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The tile
- **Given:** YouTube Music is installed
- **When:** I tap *Workout Supermix*
- **Then:** YouTube Music opens on my Workout Supermix with no Shortcuts hop, the browser opens it instead if YouTube Music is missing, and the log says which opened

---

### User Story 244:

- **Summary:** Today's hand: a card, the role of the day, and three quick starts on the big widget
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [2a1e6e8](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2a1e6e8); verified by `CardDealTests`, `EulogyRolesTests` and `AppLinkTests` (host) and `TodaysHandUITests` on the simulator (added through SpringBoard's gallery: the card and *Today, be Father to Zach* drew, a tap turned 10♥ into Q♥ with the app in the background, *Think of a card* opened the card screen counting); the phone not yet. From the stack, in the trainer's face (#219): [cecb31f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cecb31f); verified by `CardDealSubsetTests` (host: the deal's promises over a smaller deck) and `TodaysHandUITests` on the simulator against the pinned trainer commit (the trainer's 2♠ dealt in place); against the tag its tap check failed once (#230, open); the Supermix button opens the mix in YouTube Music since #372 ([dfc0d06](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/dfc0d06)), not the shortcut
- **Issues:** [#221](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/221), [#230](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/230)
- **Spec:** [Today's hand](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-native-large-widget-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** memdeck student who wants the eulogy in sight
- **I want to** see a card I can deal again, one of my eulogy's roles for the day, and the card trick, my workout music and Larry one tap away on the big widget
- **so that** every glance at the home screen is a prompt, a reminder of who I mean to be, and a start

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The widget
- **Given:** *Today's hand* is on the home screen
- **When:** I tap the card, and later *Think of a card*, *Supermix* and *Call Larry*
- **Then:** the card, from my stack and drawn as the trainer draws it, changes within a second without the app opening, it changes by itself every five minutes, with *Skip easy cards* on no breather or card within two of one shows, *Today, be* names a role from the eulogy that changes after midnight (each once in eleven days), *Think of a card* opens the card screen asking, *Supermix* opens my mix in YouTube Music (#372), and *Call Larry* opens the call screen calling

---

### User Story 250:

- **Summary:** Today's hand: a tap after a skipped redraw still deals a card that is not on screen
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [45c8e32](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/45c8e32); verified by `CardDealTests` (host: a tap avoids both the card showing and the last tap's card; 1,639 asserts fail without the change) and `TodaysHandUITests` on the simulator (iPhone 17, two iterations, both passed: a tap changed the card with the app in the background); the skipped-redraw case itself cannot be forced on the simulator; the phone not yet; the tapped card's own count carried by its button instead of recorded at timeline build (Codex on #334): [acf722d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/acf722d), host-checked only (lint); the widget build and `TodaysHandUITests` in the next build turn; the drawn entry's slot carried too, so a tap after a five-minute boundary avoids the card still on screen (Codex on #334): [a3aef08](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a3aef08), verified by `CardDealTests` (host; 1,638 asserts fail without it); the button carries the card itself, so a changed *Skip easy cards* can't hide it either (Codex on #334): [f01506f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f01506f), `CardDealTests` (host); the widget on the phone in the next build turn
- **Issues:** [#230](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/230)
- **Spec:** [Today's hand](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-native-large-widget-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** memdeck student tapping the big widget for another card
- **I want to** get a different card every tap, even when iOS was slow to redraw after the last one
- **so that** a tap never looks like it did nothing

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A tap after iOS skipped the widget's redraw
- **Given:** *Today's hand* still shows a card from before my last tap, because iOS did not redraw it
- **When:** I tap the card again
- **Then:** the widget deals a card that is not the one on screen, and the app does not open

---

### User Story 245:

- **Summary:** Think of a card in Grabber Native is the trainer's own screen
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [cecb31f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cecb31f), with think-a-card-trainer v0.1.0 (its PR #6, D15); verified by a simulator build and the screen read by eye (black, the card large, *Skip easy cards*); `CardUITests` runs again on the simulator (#229: the trainer speaks the card in lower case, and the count is told from a two's or three's rank by its size): the row opens the screen counting, the ask deals a new card, a tap switches it, Done goes home; the ask, the voice and silence during a call not yet checked on the phone; on ThinkACardUI 0.2.0 (no visible change): [6c71dc0](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/6c71dc0); verified by the simulator build (think-a-card-trainer 0.2.0 resolved) and `CardUITests` testTheTrainersScreenAsksThenDeals on iPhone 17; the phone and iPad after the merge
- **Issues:** [#219](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/219), [#229](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/229)
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Think of a card: the trainer's screen, in the app](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#think-of-a-card-the-trainers-screen-in-the-app)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man practising his stack, with Grabber Native as his home screen
- **I want to** tap *Think of a card* and get Think a Card Trainer's screen, the same one, not a copy
- **so that** the prompt I practise with is the one I built, and it improves in both apps at once

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The ask from the home screen
- **Given:** the build has my stack
- **When:** I tap *Think of a card* on the home screen
- **Then:** the trainer's screen opens with the ask started (a card up, a small three-two-one at the side, then a new card, a tap of the phone, the card said aloud), a tap on the middle switches the card, the right third asks again, the left third asks from the hard cards, and *Done* goes home

- **Scenario:** During a call
- **Given:** a call with Larry is live
- **When:** I ask for a card
- **Then:** the new card shows and nothing is said, and the call's audio is untouched

---

### User Story 220:

- **Summary:** Drill the stack from the card screen, graded, and it reaches my practice ledger
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [07433d7](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/07433d7), on think-a-card-trainer v0.3.0 (the drill, its grading, Mixed, the ledger and Stats are the library's, verified by its host tests); verified by host `just native-test`; the simulator build, `CardUITests` testDrillTheStackOpensTheTrainersDrill and the `GRABBER_DRILL=mixed` smoke check not yet; grading and the ledger on the phone not yet
- **Issues:** [think-a-card-trainer#22](https://github.com/idvorkin/think-a-card-trainer/issues/22) (a failed Stats load is not yet a copyable error)
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Think of a card: the trainer's screen, in the app](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#think-of-a-card-the-trainers-screen-in-the-app)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man practising his stack, with Grabber Native as his home screen
- **I want to** open the trainer's drill from the card screen, grade each answer with a tap or *Wrong*, and see which positions I miss
- **so that** the practice I do in this app counts in the same ledger as the trainer's and Card Picker's

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A graded drill that lands in the ledger
- **Given:** the build has my stack, and the ledger's URL and write key are pasted in the drill's *Stats*
- **When:** I tap *Drill the stack* under the card, pick *Mixed*, tap to see an answer, tap again for one I knew and press *Wrong* for one I missed, then open *Stats*
- **Then:** the drill asks both ways round from my stack (only the hard positions with *Skip easy cards* on), each answer is sent to the ledger (kept and sent later when offline), *Stats* shows the last 30 days from every source with the most missed positions first, the log never pairs a card with its position or shows the key, and *Done* returns to the card

---

### User Story 135:

- **Summary:** A link and a Shortcuts action for every screen of Grabber Native
- **Status:** implemented in [5c1f4ad](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/5c1f4ad), *Open Grabber Native* in [68229b3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/68229b3) (simulator build; Shortcuts on the phone not yet); verified by `AppLinkTests` (host) and `LinksUITests` on the simulator (real links through iOS, cold and warm: `timer?preset=10,10,2` counting down, `breathe?breath=5&minutes=2` begun over the running timer, `nowhere` on home, `timer?preset=9min` ready; Copy on the Links screen), with `just native-test-sim` passing; the Shortcuts actions, Siri and the Action Button on the phone not yet
- **Issues:** [#167](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/167)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man wiring the Action Button and a few Shortcuts to the native app
- **I want to** pick *Start Gym Timer* (1 MIN) or *Start Box Breathing* (5 minutes) from Grabber Native's actions, or paste `grabbernative://timer?preset=1min` copied from the app's Links screen
- **so that** the workout or the breathing is running before I have opened, navigated or pressed anything, and every screen is one tap from wherever I put it

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Links, cold and warm
- **Given:** Grabber Native is closed (and again with it open on another screen)
- **When:** I open `grabbernative://timer?preset=10,10,2`, `grabbernative://breathe?breath=5&minutes=2`, `grabbernative://today`, `grabbernative://places`, `grabbernative://cockpit`, `grabbernative://call` or `grabbernative://card`
- **Then:** each lands on its screen, the timer counting down and the breathing begun within about a second; `grabbernative://nowhere` opens the home screen, a preset it does not know opens the timer ready, and none of them shows an error

- **Scenario:** Shortcuts and the Links screen
- **Given:** the Shortcuts app lists *Open Grabber Native*, *Open Today*, *Start Gym Timer*, *Start Box Breathing*, *Open Places*, *Open Cockpit* and *Call Larry* under Grabber Native
- **When:** I run *Start Gym Timer* with 1 MIN while the app is closed, and later tap Copy beside a link on *Links for Shortcuts* at the bottom of the home screen
- **Then:** the app opens on the timer with 1 MIN counting down, and the clipboard holds exactly that link; Context Grabber's own `grabber://` links still open Context Grabber

- **Scenario:** A shortcut to the app itself
- **Given:** the app is closed or showing another screen
- **When:** I run *Open Grabber Native* (or say "Open Grabber Native")
- **Then:** the app opens on its home screen with nothing started

### User Story 136:

- **Summary:** The usage left on a home-screen tile, with one-tap starts beside it
- **Status:** implemented in [7b70242](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7b70242); verified by `UsageSnapshotTests` (host: the round trip, the countdown and *to spend* at drawing time, the age, the placeholder) and `UsageTileUITests` on the simulator (the medium tile added through SpringBoard's gallery draws the real Cockpit reading, *just now*; its Gym Timer starts the last preset); the orange age over hours, low and critical bars, the placeholder on screen, Breathe and Call Larry from the tile, and the App Group on a device-signed build not yet on the phone
- **Issues:** [#168](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/168)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man deciding whether to start another long session with Claude, or whether this week's allowance is about to go unspent
- **I want to** see Week, the model and Voice left on a Grabber Native tile on the home screen, and start the Gym Timer, Box breathing or a call to Larry from the same tile
- **so that** the budget is a glance and the things I do daily are one tap, without opening the app first

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The tile after a reading
- **Given:** the small or medium live tile is on the home screen and Grabber Native has loaded a reading on the tailnet
- **When:** I look at the home screen, and again two hours later without opening the app
- **Then:** the tile shows the strip's bars and numbers with the strip's orange and red, then *12m ago* in grey, later *2h ago* in orange, and *31% to spend* in green once the week resets within a day with more than 20% left

- **Scenario:** One tap, and before any reading
- **Given:** the medium tile, on a phone where Grabber Native has never loaded a reading
- **When:** I look at it, then tap Gym Timer
- **Then:** it reads *Open Grabber Native* with no numbers, and the tap opens the app with the last preset counting down; Breathe begins a session and Call Larry starts the call the same way

### User Story 137:

- **Summary:** My eulogy, its song and the blog's recent changes, one tap each
- **Issues:** [#177](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/177), [#195](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/195), [#197](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/197), [#201](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/201), [#205](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/205)
- **Status:** implemented in [0a3f541](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/0a3f541), [2b75d3a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2b75d3a), [6dc7848](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/6dc7848); verified by `BlogLinksTests` (host, the post as served 2026-10-07) and `EulogyUITests` on the simulator (Eulogy and Recent bring Safari forward; the song plays in the app, pauses, resumes from where it was after the sheet closes, and Open on Suno opens the song the post embeds; the scrubber moves it, restart plays from the start, and with the sheet closed the small player pauses in place, opens the sheet as it is, and its ✕ takes it away); the lock screen, playing on with the phone locked, and the phone not yet
- **Spec:** [native Eulogy](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-native-eulogy-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** who rereads his eulogy, plays its song and checks what changed on his blog most days
- **I want to** reach each from the home screen in one tap
- **so that** the daily practice costs no typing and no hunting

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The song in the app
- **Given:** I am on the home screen, online or not
- **When:** I tap *Eulogy song*
- **Then:** a sheet titled *How Igor wants to live* opens and the song starts playing inside the app, with a pause button and how far through it is; it pauses whatever else was playing

- **Scenario:** Keep listening
- **Given:** the song is playing
- **When:** I close the sheet, lock the phone, or go to another app
- **Then:** the song keeps playing, and the lock screen shows it with play and pause

- **Scenario:** Pick up where I left off
- **Given:** I paused the song partway and closed the sheet
- **When:** I tap *Eulogy song* again
- **Then:** the sheet shows the same place and the song resumes from it, not from the start

- **Scenario:** A call comes first
- **Given:** the song is playing, or a Larry call is live
- **When:** I start a call, or tap play on the song
- **Then:** starting the call pauses the song where it is; with the call live the song does not play and its sheet says it waits for the call to end

- **Scenario:** Scrub and restart
- **Given:** the song's sheet is open
- **When:** I drag the scrubber to the last chorus, or tap restart
- **Then:** the song carries on from where I let go (still playing, or still paused), or plays from the start

- **Scenario:** The small player
- **Given:** the song is playing or paused partway and I closed its sheet
- **When:** I look at the home screen
- **Then:** a small player sits in the bottom-left corner with the song's place and play/pause; tapping it opens the sheet, its ✕ stops the song and it goes away, and it goes away by itself when the song ends

- **Scenario:** The song on Suno
- **Given:** the eulogy post embeds a Suno song
- **When:** I tap *Open on Suno* in the song's sheet
- **Then:** that song opens on Suno (the app if installed, else the browser), and the log names the song and that it came from the post

- **Scenario:** Offline
- **Given:** the phone cannot reach the blog
- **When:** I tap *Open on Suno*
- **Then:** the song found last time opens; if none was ever found, the eulogy post opens and the screen says the song could not be found

- **Scenario:** The post and recent changes
- **Given:** the home screen
- **When:** I tap *Eulogy*, and later *Recent*
- **Then:** idvork.in/eulogy and idvork.in/recent open in the browser

### User Story 138:

- **Summary:** The eulogy song plays at its own speed, in the car too
- **Issues:** [#370](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/370)
- **Status:** implemented in [d0a1353](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d0a1353) (the session set before the player is prepared, a player prepared at another sample rate replaced at the same place, and the rate, route and any clock drift in the log) and [4ff9f1b](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/4ff9f1b) with the review fix after it (a song that will not load, or will not start, lets the session go so other audio comes back); verified by `just native-lint`, and the app compiled in the simulator build at 3106eb2 (2026-10-18 build turn); the car on the phone is still for Igor to check
- **Spec:** [native Eulogy](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-native-eulogy-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** who plays his eulogy song while driving, often right after a Larry call or the Cockpit
- **I want to** hear it at its own speed, whatever audio route was there before
- **so that** the song is the song, not a chipmunk that ends in 45 seconds

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Right after the hands-free line
- **Given:** the phone is on the car's hands-free line and the Cockpit was just open
- **When:** I tap *Eulogy song* and listen for a minute
- **Then:** the song sounds as recorded and its clock reads about 1:00, not three times that

### User Story 247:

- **Summary:** A random page of my blog, one tap away
- **Issues:** [#259](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/259)
- **Status:** implemented in [456463e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/456463e); verified on the simulator by `EulogyUITests` (Random brings Safari forward, 2026-10-11); the phone not yet
- **Spec:** [native Eulogy](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-native-eulogy-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** whose blog has years of posts he no longer remembers writing
- **I want to** open a random page of it from the home screen
- **so that** I reread something I'd forgotten without choosing it

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A random page
- **Given:** the home screen, online
- **When:** I tap *Random*
- **Then:** idvork.in/random opens in the browser and shows a page of the blog the blog picked; tapping again later usually lands somewhere else

- **Scenario:** Like any launcher
- **Given:** a phone that already has its own order of launchers
- **When:** this build arrives
- **Then:** *Random* shows at the end until I move or hide it from Settings
