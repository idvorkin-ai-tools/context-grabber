# From the home screen: widgets, the card, and links

Getting to the thing without opening the app: the Today widget, the memdeck card on the home and lock screens, links that land where I mean, and the Shortcuts app. On the iPad, a tile's screen in a window of its own.

Part of the [user stories](README.md); persona and format are described there.

---

### User Story 120:

- **Summary:** Today's numbers on the home screen without opening the app
- **Status:** implemented in [b789147](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b789147), [dd1a899](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/dd1a899); verified on the phone (daily)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** at the kitchen counter glancing at the phone
- **I want to** see today's steps, sleep and exercise minutes on a home-screen widget
- **so that** "am I on track" costs a glance, not a launch

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** After a grab
- **Given:** the medium Today widget is on the home screen
- **When:** I press Grab Context in the app and return to the home screen
- **Then:** within two minutes the widget shows "Today · <weekday>" with steps, sleep hours and exercise minutes from that grab (an em-dash for anything never grabbed), and tapping the top block opens the app on the dashboard

---

### User Story 121:

- **Summary:** Start a timer from the home screen in one tap
- **Status:** implemented in [a5ff68d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a5ff68d), [b789147](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b789147), [83e2bdc](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/83e2bdc), [2ef4a17](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2ef4a17); verified by `deepLink.test.ts` and on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** lifter with the bell already in hand
- **I want to** tap 1 MIN, 2 MIN or 5-1 on the widget
- **so that** the timer is counting down before I have opened, navigated or pressed START

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The 1 MIN tile
- **Given:** the Today widget is on the home screen and the app is closed
- **When:** I tap the 1 MIN tile
- **Then:** the app opens on the Gym Timer with the 1 MIN preset selected and the countdown running within about a second — the same when the app was already open on another tab

---

### User Story 122:

- **Summary:** Bump the day's tally from the widget without launching the app
- **Status:** implemented in [d00e45b](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d00e45b), [c6fc609](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c6fc609); verified by `counter.test.ts` and on the phone
- **Issues:** [#29](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/29) — the counter half shipped; the quick 5-minute meditation preset asked for there is still open

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man doing a set of squats between meetings
- **I want to** tap +1 on the widget after each one
- **so that** "I did a thing" is one tap and today's count is on the Move tab when I look

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** +1 in place
- **Given:** the Today widget shows the tally row with its count
- **When:** I tap +1 on the widget
- **Then:** the count on the widget rises by one without the app opening, the Move tab's tally marks show the same number, and at local midnight the count starts again from zero

---

### User Story 123:

- **Summary:** Reflect from the widget: affirm, be grateful, or open the journal
- **Status:** implemented in [d61f15a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d61f15a), [2e4fd9f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2e4fd9f); verified by `deepLink.test.ts` and on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man who just noticed something worth writing down
- **I want to** tap 🎯 Affirm or 🙏 Grateful on the widget and land straight on that card
- **so that** the noticing is not lost to the four taps it would take to get there

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Straight to the card
- **Given:** the widget's Reflect strip shows today's counts ("☀️2  ✓1  🙏4") and the three tiles
- **When:** I tap 🙏 Grateful
- **Then:** the app opens with the Grateful card already up, and after I save, the widget's gratitude count reads one more on its next refresh

---

### User Story 124:

- **Summary:** Call Larry from the widget's ☎ pill
- **Status:** implemented in [8d35bb6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8d35bb6); verified on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man with a thought for Larry and the phone on the counter
- **I want to** tap the ☎ Call pill on the widget
- **so that** the call is connecting before the thought is gone

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** One tap to a call
- **Given:** the Today widget is on the home screen
- **When:** I tap ☎ Call
- **Then:** the app opens on the Call tab already *connecting…* on the remembered backend, and if a call is already live it simply shows that call

---

### User Story 125:

- **Summary:** Tap the Live Activity and land on the timer
- **Status:** implemented in [a5ff68d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a5ff68d); verified on the phone; native app: [ea8c689](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/ea8c689), by construction rather than a link — the card lives only while the timer's full screen is up (RESET and leaving end it, a killed launch's card is ended at the next launch), so opening the app is opening the timer; verified by reading the code only, the tap not yet on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** lifter watching the countdown in the Dynamic Island
- **I want to** tap it and be on the Gym Timer screen
- **so that** pause, reset and the phase are one tap away, not the dashboard

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** From the island to the timer
- **Given:** a rounds timer is running and the Live Activity shows the countdown
- **When:** I tap the Live Activity
- **Then:** the app opens on the Gym Timer in rounds mode with the timer still running, not on the dashboard

---

### User Story 126:

- **Summary:** A link opens the app exactly where I meant, from anywhere
- **Status:** implemented in [a5ff68d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a5ff68d), [b789147](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b789147), [cef19fc](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cef19fc), [a902080](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a902080), [c81b9b1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c81b9b1); verified by `deepLink.test.ts` and on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man wiring the Action Button and a few Shortcuts
- **I want to** open `grabber://timer?preset=1min&autostart=1`, `grabber://grab`, `grabber://reflect/grateful`, `grabber://call?via=eleven`, `grabber://cockpit` or `grabber://card` and have each do the obvious thing
- **so that** every surface that can open a URL can drive the app, and a typo never crashes it

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Routes, cold and warm
- **Given:** the app is closed (and again with it open on the Today tab)
- **When:** I open `grabber://timer?preset=1min&autostart=1`
- **Then:** the timer starts within a second either way; `com.idvorkin.contextgrabber://` behaves identically; an unknown preset falls back to the last one; and a malformed link opens the dashboard with no error

---

### User Story 127:

- **Summary:** Always a playing card on the big widget, and a fresh one when I want it
- **Status:** implemented in [c81b9b1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c81b9b1); verified by `just check-deal` (the deal's promises under plain `swiftc`) and on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As a** memdeck student who keeps the large widget on two home-screen pages
- **I want to** see a random card beside today's numbers, changing every five minutes, and a different one the instant I tap it
- **so that** every glance is a prompt to find the card in the stack

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The card deals
- **Given:** the large Today widget is on both home-screen pages
- **When:** I tap the card on one of them
- **Then:** within a second it is a different card on both pages and the lock screen, the app does not open, it is never the same card twice in a row, and left alone for a quarter hour it has changed more than once on its own

---

### User Story 128:

- **Summary:** The same card on the lock screen, and a tap that takes me to it
- **Status:** implemented in [c81b9b1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c81b9b1); verified on the phone

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** glancing at the locked phone
- **I want to** see "7♣ memdeck" under the clock, and land on a big card if I tap it
- **so that** the prompt is there before I unlock, and the practice is one tap further

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The lock-screen widget
- **Given:** the rectangular, round or inline memdeck widget is on the lock screen
- **When:** I tap it
- **Then:** it showed the same card as the big widget, was never blank, and the app opens on the Card tab with a big card that differs from the one the lock screen showed

---

### User Story 129:

- **Summary:** The Card tab: tap for another, or "think of a card" and wait five seconds
- **Issues:** [#219](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/219)
- **Status:** implemented in [c81b9b1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c81b9b1); verified by `CardScreen.test.tsx` and on the phone; native app (#219, Igor 2026-10-08: *"let's do it inline"*): implemented in [fdec37f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/fdec37f); verified by `CardDealTests` (host: the deal's promises, and the same card as the old app for the same moment) and `CardUITests` on the simulator (the home row opens face down counting, a card face up at zero, a tap deals another, *Never mind* keeps the card); replaced the same day by the trainer's own screen, story 245

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man about to do the trick for someone
- **I want to** press *Think of a card*, see the card turn face down with a count from five, and get a new card face up when it hits zero
- **so that** the pause is me saying "think of a card" and shuffling, and the reveal is theirs

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Think of a card
- **Given:** the Card tab is open on a fresh card (every open deals one; a tap deals another)
- **When:** I press *Think of a card*
- **Then:** the card goes face down counting five, four, three…, a new card is face up at zero, pressing *Never mind* mid-count stops it with the previous card face up, and on leaving the tab or locking the phone the widgets show the last card the tab dealt

---

### User Story 133:

- **Summary:** Think of a card in Grabber Native opens Igor's trainer
- **Status:** replaced by story 129 in the app (#219, Igor 2026-10-08: *"I don't think it's worthy of its own app"*); was [0152b68](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/0152b68)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man about to do the trick, with Grabber Native open
- **I want to** tap *Think of a card* and be in Think a Card Trainer with the beat already started
- **so that** I practise with the trainer I built for it, not a second card app

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The row
- **Given:** Think a Card Trainer is installed on the phone
- **When:** I tap *Think of a card* on Grabber Native's home screen
- **Then:** the trainer comes to the front and starts "think of a card" as its watch complication's tap does, and if the trainer is not installed the home screen says so instead

---

### User Story 130:

- **Summary:** "Call Larry" and "Open Cockpit" by name in the Shortcuts app and to Siri
- **Status:** implemented in [8d35bb6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8d35bb6), [a902080](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a902080); verified on the phone
- **Issues:** [#75](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/75), [#85](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/85) (closed)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man building an automation without wanting to remember a URL
- **I want to** pick *Call Larry* (with an optional backend) or *Open Cockpit* from Context Grabber's actions, or say "Call Larry in Context Grabber"
- **so that** the call and the dashboard are things I choose from a menu or speak, next to *Increment Counter*

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A shortcut of one action
- **Given:** the Shortcuts app lists *Call Larry* (Backend: Gemini, ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Drill, Direct Larry, or blank) and *Open Cockpit* under Context Grabber
- **When:** I run a shortcut of just *Call Larry* with ElevenLabs while the app is closed
- **Then:** the app opens on the Call tab and goes *connecting… ElevenLabs* → *live* with no tap; run while a call is live it shows that call without restarting it; and *Open Cockpit* opens the Cockpit tab the same way

---

### User Story 131:

- **Summary:** Know which build is actually running on the phone
- **Status:** implemented in [bafc357](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/bafc357), [8b28d51](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8b28d51), [0bb87bf](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/0bb87bf); verified on the phone (every OTA)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man who just got told "an update is live" in a session
- **I want to** open About and read the commit message, short sha, branch and update id that are running
- **so that** "did the OTA land" is answered without a Mac

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** After an OTA
- **Given:** an update was published and the app has been opened twice since
- **When:** I open About
- **Then:** the Build Info shows the new commit's message and sha, the update channel, runtime version and update id, and *Check for update* reports what it did

---

### User Story 132:

- **Summary:** Today's path on a home-screen map widget
- **Status:** not implemented; asks: [#45](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/45), [#42](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/42) (which interpretation is still open)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** wondering where the day went before opening anything
- **I want to** see today's GPS trail drawn on a small map on the home screen
- **so that** the day's shape is a glance, like the steps are

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The map widget
- **Given:** background tracking has recorded today's trail
- **When:** I look at the home screen
- **Then:** a map widget shows today's route over the map with the current position marked, refreshed with the last grab


---

### User Story 134:

- **Summary:** Open Exercise Analyzer from the native home screen
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [225d739](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/225d739); verified by `ExerciseAnalyzerLinkUITests` on the simulator with Exercise Analyzer's url-scheme build installed (tap the row, Exercise Analyzer runs in front); the phone still to be checked by Igor

- **so that** recording a set is one tap from where I already am

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The row
- **Given:** Exercise Analyzer is installed
- **When:** I tap *Exercise Analyzer* on Grabber Native's home screen
- **Then:** Exercise Analyzer comes to the front, the session log has `open_exercise_analyzer` with ok true, and without it installed the home screen says it is not installed

### User Story 243:

- **Summary:** Workout Supermix from the native home screen
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [fae3e8c](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/fae3e8c); verified by `WorkoutSupermixUITests` on the simulator (tap the row, Shortcuts runs in front; the simulator has no such shortcut); YouTube Music playing the mix on the phone not yet; superseded by story 139 (#372): the tile opens the mix's link directly, not the shortcut
- **Issues:** [#220](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/220)
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Workout Supermix, one tap away](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#workout-supermix-one-tap-away)

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Picking a mix
- **Given:** YouTube Music is installed
- **When:** I press and hold the Workout Supermix tile, then tap *Liked music* or *Feel Good Supermix* in the popover
- **Then:** a popover of Workout Supermix (the kettlebell in headphones), Liked music (a heart) and Feel Good Supermix (a sun) opens beside the tile, each drawn, the one I tap opens in YouTube Music (the browser without it), a tap outside the popover opens nothing, a plain tap still opens the Workout Supermix, a mix that will not open shows a copyable problem under the tiles until the next try or a newer message, and the log names the mix and which opened

---

### User Story 226:

- **Summary:** Today's numbers on the usage tile, and daily strip under the usage left
- **Issues:** [#396](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/396), [#404](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/404), [#427](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/427)

- **Spec:** [native live tile, "Today's numbers"](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-native-live-tile-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man glancing at his phone's home screen
- **I want to** see my Meditation and Journal marks, Balloons and Magic counts, steps, HRV and exercise on the usage tile
- **so that** the day's state is one glance away without opening the app

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The tile follows today's strip
- **Given:** the app has written today's strip and Health reading, and I change the strip with a tap, hold, week edit or peer sync
- **When:** I look at the usage tile on my home screen, then again after local midnight
- **Then:** both sizes show the app's Meditation and Journal done/not-done marks, Balloons and Magic counts, and steps, HRV and exercise with small symbols fitting the small tile, with no sleep; each part is absent before its first write and after midnight until written for the new day, and a strip change does not revive yesterday's Health numbers

- **Scenario:** The tile's strip is coloured as the home page's (#427)
- **Given:** today I have meditated and blown one balloon, but not journalled or done magic
- **When:** I look at the usage tile
- **Then:** the meditation symbol is green and the balloon pink, as on the home page, and the journal and magic symbols stay grey

---

### User Story 222:

- **Summary:** Holding the music tile opens a popover of drawn mixes, not a list
- **Issues:** [#391](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/391)
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [61fba62](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/61fba62); verified by `HoldChoicesTests` (host: the three mixes in order, each with its art) and `WorkoutSupermixUITests.testTheHoldPopoverShowsEachMix` (simulator: the popover lists all three, Liked opens in the browser); the drawn art and the light tick on the phone not yet
- **Spec:** [Press and hold a tile: a popover of drawn icons](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-press-and-hold-popovers-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man at the home screen with a tile in mind
- **I want to** press and hold the Workout Supermix tile and see the mixes as drawn tiles
- **so that** picking music looks like the home screen and reads at a glance

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The music popover
- **Given:** YouTube Music is installed
- **When:** I press and hold the Workout Supermix tile and tap the heart
- **Then:** a popover pointing at the tile shows Workout Supermix, Liked music and Feel Good Supermix as drawn tiles with their names, Workout first; my likes open in YouTube Music; a tap outside instead closes it with nothing opened; and the log has the popover opening and `from: home_popover` with the mix

### User Story 225:

- **Summary:** Hold the card tile to think, see a card or drill
- **Issues:** [#391](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/391), [#400](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/400) (the drill's prompt is a button, so the UI test looks for one)
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [61fba62](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/61fba62); verified by `HoldChoicesTests` (host: think, face up, drill in order) and `HoldPopoverUITests.testTheCardPopoverOpensTheDrill` (simulator: Drill the stack opens the drill), which looks for the prompt as a button since #400; a hand simulator run at [ea7e334](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/ea7e334) passed 4 tests with 0 failures, but its record does not name them, so whether it re-ran this test is unconfirmed; on the phone not yet
- **Spec:** [Press and hold a tile: a popover of drawn icons](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-press-and-hold-popovers-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man at the home screen with a tile in mind
- **I want to** press and hold Think of a card and pick think of a card, a card face up, or drill the stack
- **so that** the card practice I want is one gesture away

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Into the drill
- **Given:** the home screen
- **When:** I press and hold the Think of a card tile and tap *Drill the stack*
- **Then:** the stack drill opens, and a plain tap on the tile still counts down to a card as before

### User Story 244:

- **Summary:** Today's hand: a card, the role of the day, and three quick starts on the big widget
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [2a1e6e8](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2a1e6e8); verified by `CardDealTests`, `EulogyRolesTests` and `AppLinkTests` (host) and `TodaysHandUITests` on the simulator (added through SpringBoard's gallery: the card and *Today, be Father to Zach* drew, a tap turned 10♥ into Q♥ with the app in the background, *Think of a card* opened the card screen counting); the phone not yet. From the stack, in the trainer's face (#219): [cecb31f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cecb31f); verified by `CardDealSubsetTests` (host: the deal's promises over a smaller deck) and `TodaysHandUITests` on the simulator against the pinned trainer commit (the trainer's 2♠ dealt in place); against the tag its tap check failed once (#230, open); the Supermix button opens the mix in YouTube Music since #372 ([dfc0d06](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/dfc0d06)), not the shortcut
- **Issues:** [#221](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/221), [#230](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/230)
- **Spec:** [Today's hand](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-native-large-widget-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** memdeck student who wants the eulogy in sight
- **I want to** see a card I can deal again, one of my eulogy's roles for the day, and the card trick, my workout music and Larry one tap away on the big widget
- **so that** every glance at the home screen is a prompt, a reminder of who I mean to be, and a start

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The widget
- **Given:** *Today's hand* is on the home screen
- **When:** I tap the card, and later *Think of a card*, *Supermix* and *Call Larry*
- **Then:** the card, from my stack and drawn as the trainer draws it, changes within a second without the app opening, it changes by itself every five minutes, with *Skip easy cards* on no breather or card within two of one shows, *Today, be* names a role from the eulogy that changes after midnight (each once in eleven days), *Think of a card* opens the card screen asking, *Supermix* opens my mix in YouTube Music (#372), and *Call Larry* opens the call screen calling

### User Story 250:

- **Summary:** Today's hand: a tap after a skipped redraw still deals a card that is not on screen
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [45c8e32](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/45c8e32); verified by `CardDealTests` (host: a tap avoids both the card showing and the last tap's card; 1,639 asserts fail without the change) and `TodaysHandUITests` on the simulator (iPhone 17, two iterations, both passed: a tap changed the card with the app in the background); the skipped-redraw case itself cannot be forced on the simulator; the phone not yet; the tapped card's own count carried by its button instead of recorded at timeline build (Codex on #334): [acf722d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/acf722d), host-checked only (lint); the widget build and `TodaysHandUITests` in the next build turn; the drawn entry's slot carried too, so a tap after a five-minute boundary avoids the card still on screen (Codex on #334): [a3aef08](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a3aef08), verified by `CardDealTests` (host; 1,638 asserts fail without it); the button carries the card itself, so a changed *Skip easy cards* can't hide it either (Codex on #334): [f01506f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f01506f), `CardDealTests` (host); the widget on the phone in the next build turn
- **Issues:** [#230](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/230)
- **Spec:** [Today's hand](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-native-large-widget-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** memdeck student tapping the big widget for another card
- **I want to** get a different card every tap, even when iOS was slow to redraw after the last one
- **so that** a tap never looks like it did nothing

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A tap after iOS skipped the widget's redraw
- **Given:** *Today's hand* still shows a card from before my last tap, because iOS did not redraw it
- **When:** I tap the card again
- **Then:** the widget deals a card that is not the one on screen, and the app does not open

### User Story 245:

- **Summary:** Think of a card in Grabber Native is the trainer's own screen
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [cecb31f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cecb31f), with think-a-card-trainer v0.1.0 (its PR #6, D15); verified by a simulator build and the screen read by eye (black, the card large, *Skip easy cards*); `CardUITests` runs again on the simulator (#229: the trainer speaks the card in lower case, and the count is told from a two's or three's rank by its size): the row opens the screen counting, the ask deals a new card, a tap switches it, Done goes home; the ask, the voice and silence during a call not yet checked on the phone; on ThinkACardUI 0.2.0 (no visible change): [6c71dc0](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/6c71dc0); verified by the simulator build (think-a-card-trainer 0.2.0 resolved) and `CardUITests` testTheTrainersScreenAsksThenDeals on iPhone 17; the phone and iPad after the merge
- **Issues:** [#219](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/219), [#229](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/229)
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Think of a card: the trainer's screen, in the app](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#think-of-a-card-the-trainers-screen-in-the-app)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man practising his stack, with Grabber Native as his home screen
- **I want to** tap *Think of a card* and get Think a Card Trainer's screen, the same one, not a copy
- **so that** the prompt I practise with is the one I built, and it improves in both apps at once

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The ask from the home screen
- **Given:** the build has my stack
- **When:** I tap *Think of a card* on the home screen
- **Then:** the trainer's screen opens with the ask started (a card up, a small three-two-one at the side, then a new card, a tap of the phone, the card said aloud), a tap on the middle switches the card, the right third asks again, the left third asks from the hard cards, and *Done* goes home

- **Scenario:** During a call
- **Given:** a call with Larry is live
- **When:** I ask for a card
- **Then:** the new card shows and nothing is said, and the call's audio is untouched

### User Story 220:

- **Summary:** Drill the stack from the card screen, graded, and it reaches my practice ledger
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [07433d7](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/07433d7) (the `GRABBER_DRILL` hook in [244fa20](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/244fa20); a shake reports from inside the drill since [5f7df26](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/5f7df26), naming the drill as its screen since [631daff](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/631daff), when the hook opens it too since [240a405](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/240a405)), on think-a-card-trainer v0.3.0 (the drill, its grading, Mixed, the ledger and Stats are the library's, verified by its host tests); verified by host `just native-test`; the simulator build, `CardUITests` testDrillTheStackOpensTheTrainersDrill and the `GRABBER_DRILL=mixed` smoke check not yet; grading and the ledger on the phone not yet; on think-a-card-trainer v0.3.5 in [8876808](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8876808): the drill's *Wrong* is a large target at the right edge (think-a-card-trainer issue 33) and *Mixed* no longer runs too many numbers in a row (think-a-card-trainer issue 34), both the library's and verified by its tests; host `just native-test`; the app build and the drill on the phone not yet; on think-a-card-trainer v0.3.6 in [8d5ae94](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8d5ae94) (#569, #570): the answer centred under the question and *Wrong* a small half-clear button in its own row at the bottom right, replacing the large strip above; verified by the library's tests and a simulator build here; the drill on the phone not yet; a failed Stats load is a copyable error (story 227) in [f0f149e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f0f149e) (#563): simulator build only, the failure itself not yet seen on a simulator or the phone; `CardUITests` testDrillTheStackOpensTheTrainersDrill passes on the simulator with its fix in [29f4561](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/29f4561) (#400: it taps the drill's own Done and finds the prompt as a button; no app change); a hand simulator run at [ea7e334](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/ea7e334) passed 4 tests with 0 failures, but its record does not name them, so whether it ran the later closing check that the drill has gone is unconfirmed
- **Issues:** [#400](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/400) (the UI test tapped the wrong Done), [#569](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/569), [#570](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/570) (the answer centred, Wrong smaller and half-clear at the bottom: ThinkACardUI 0.3.6, think-a-card-trainer#38), [#563](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/563) (a failed Stats load is a copyable error, story 227: the library lets the host present it since think-a-card-trainer#22, v0.3.1), [think-a-card-trainer#33](https://github.com/idvorkin/think-a-card-trainer/issues/33) (the Wrong button), [think-a-card-trainer#34](https://github.com/idvorkin/think-a-card-trainer/issues/34) (Mixed)
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Think of a card: the trainer's screen, in the app](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#think-of-a-card-the-trainers-screen-in-the-app)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man practising his stack, with Grabber Native as his home screen
- **I want to** open the trainer's drill from the card screen, grade each answer with a tap or *Wrong*, and see which positions I miss
- **so that** the practice I do in this app counts in the same ledger as the trainer's and Card Picker's

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A graded drill that lands in the ledger
- **Given:** the build has my stack, and the ledger's URL and write key are pasted in the drill's *Stats*
- **When:** I tap *Drill the stack* under the card, pick *Mixed*, tap to see an answer, tap again for one I knew and press *Wrong* for one I missed, then open *Stats*
- **Then:** the drill asks both ways round from my stack (only the hard positions with *Skip easy cards* on), a tap shows the answer as the position alone, centred under the question, and *Wrong* is a small half-clear button at the bottom right, each answer is sent to the ledger (kept and sent later when offline), *Stats* shows the last 30 days from every source as a difficulty grid, one cell per position in stack order with its card face, with a *Taps / Voice* picker, the log never pairs a card with its position or shows the key, and *Done* returns to the card

---

### User Story 227:

- **Summary:** A Stats load that fails in the drill is a copyable error
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [f0f149e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f0f149e) (#563), on the drill of story 220; verified by a simulator build only, the failure itself not yet seen on a simulator or the phone
- **Issues:** [#563](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/563)
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app — Think of a card: the trainer's screen, in the app](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md#think-of-a-card-the-trainers-screen-in-the-app)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man practising his stack, who reports what goes wrong by pasting it
- **I want to** copy a failed Stats load with the state behind it
- **so that** the report says what the drill asked for and held, not just that it failed

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A Stats load that fails
- **Given:** the ledger can't be reached or refuses the key
- **When:** I open *Stats* in the drill
- **Then:** the sheet shows the failure as a copyable error carrying the days asked for and the answers waiting, never the key

### User Story 135:

- **Summary:** A link and a Shortcuts action for every screen of Grabber Native
- **Status:** implemented in [5c1f4ad](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/5c1f4ad), *Open Grabber Native* in [68229b3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/68229b3) (simulator build; Shortcuts on the phone not yet); verified by `AppLinkTests` (host) and `LinksUITests` on the simulator (real links through iOS, cold and warm: `timer?preset=10,10,2` counting down, `breathe?breath=5&minutes=2` begun over the running timer, `nowhere` on home, `timer?preset=9min` ready; Copy on the Links screen), with `just native-test-sim` passing; the Shortcuts actions, Siri and the Action Button on the phone not yet
- **Issues:** [#167](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/167)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man wiring the Action Button and a few Shortcuts to the native app
- **I want to** pick *Start Gym Timer* (1 MIN) or *Start Box Breathing* (5 minutes) from Grabber Native's actions, or paste `grabbernative://timer?preset=1min` copied from the app's Links screen
- **so that** the workout or the breathing is running before I have opened, navigated or pressed anything, and every screen is one tap from wherever I put it

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Links, cold and warm
- **Given:** Grabber Native is closed (and again with it open on another screen)
- **When:** I open `grabbernative://timer?preset=10,10,2`, `grabbernative://breathe?breath=5&minutes=2`, `grabbernative://today`, `grabbernative://places`, `grabbernative://cockpit`, `grabbernative://call` or `grabbernative://card`
- **Then:** each lands on its screen, the timer counting down and the breathing begun within about a second; `grabbernative://nowhere` opens the home screen, a preset it does not know opens the timer ready, and none of them shows an error

- **Scenario:** Shortcuts and the Links screen
- **Given:** the Shortcuts app lists *Open Grabber Native*, *Open Today*, *Start Gym Timer*, *Start Box Breathing*, *Open Places*, *Open Cockpit* and *Call Larry* under Grabber Native
- **When:** I run *Start Gym Timer* with 1 MIN while the app is closed, and later tap Copy beside a link on *Links for Shortcuts* at the bottom of the home screen
- **Then:** the app opens on the timer with 1 MIN counting down, and the clipboard holds exactly that link; Context Grabber's own `grabber://` links still open Context Grabber

- **Scenario:** A shortcut to the app itself
- **Given:** the app is closed or showing another screen
- **When:** I run *Open Grabber Native* (or say "Open Grabber Native")
- **Then:** the app opens on its home screen with nothing started

---

### User Story 136:

- **Summary:** The usage left on a home-screen tile, with one-tap starts beside it
- **Status:** implemented in [7b70242](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7b70242); verified by `UsageSnapshotTests` (host: the round trip, the countdown and *to spend* at drawing time, the age, the placeholder) and `UsageTileUITests` on the simulator (the medium tile added through SpringBoard's gallery draws the real Cockpit reading, *just now*; its Gym Timer starts the last preset); the orange age over hours, low and critical bars, the placeholder on screen, Breathe and Call Larry from the tile, and the App Group on a device-signed build not yet on the phone
- **Issues:** [#168](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/168)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** man deciding whether to start another long session with Claude, or whether this week's allowance is about to go unspent
- **I want to** see Week, the model and Voice left on a Grabber Native tile on the home screen, and start the Gym Timer, Box breathing or a call to Larry from the same tile
- **so that** the budget is a glance and the things I do daily are one tap, without opening the app first

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The tile after a reading
- **Given:** the small or medium live tile is on the home screen and Grabber Native has loaded a reading on the tailnet
- **When:** I look at the home screen, and again two hours later without opening the app
- **Then:** the tile shows the strip's bars and numbers with the strip's orange and red, then *12m ago* in grey, later *2h ago* in orange, and *31% to spend* in green once the week resets within a day with more than 20% left

- **Scenario:** One tap, and before any reading
- **Given:** the medium tile, on a phone where Grabber Native has never loaded a reading
- **When:** I look at it, then tap Gym Timer
- **Then:** it reads *Open Grabber Native* with no numbers, and the tap opens the app with the last preset counting down; Breathe begins a session and Call Larry starts the call the same way

---

### User Story 137:

- **Summary:** My eulogy, its song and the blog's recent changes, one tap each
- **Issues:** [#177](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/177), [#195](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/195), [#197](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/197), [#201](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/201), [#205](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/205)
- **Status:** implemented in [0a3f541](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/0a3f541), [2b75d3a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2b75d3a), [6dc7848](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/6dc7848); verified by `BlogLinksTests` (host, the post as served 2026-10-07) and `EulogyUITests` on the simulator (Eulogy and Recent bring Safari forward; the song plays in the app, pauses, resumes from where it was after the sheet closes, and Open on Suno opens the song the post embeds; the scrubber moves it, restart plays from the start, and with the sheet closed the small player pauses in place, opens the sheet as it is, and its ✕ takes it away); the lock screen, playing on with the phone locked, and the phone not yet
- **Spec:** [native Eulogy](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-native-eulogy-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** who rereads his eulogy, plays its song and checks what changed on his blog most days
- **I want to** reach each from the home screen in one tap
- **so that** the daily practice costs no typing and no hunting

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The song in the app
- **Given:** I am on the home screen, online or not
- **When:** I tap *Eulogy song*
- **Then:** a sheet titled *How Igor wants to live* opens and the song starts playing inside the app, with a pause button and how far through it is; it pauses whatever else was playing

- **Scenario:** Keep listening
- **Given:** the song is playing
- **When:** I close the sheet, lock the phone, or go to another app
- **Then:** the song keeps playing, and the lock screen shows it with play and pause

- **Scenario:** Pick up where I left off
- **Given:** I paused the song partway and closed the sheet
- **When:** I tap *Eulogy song* again
- **Then:** the sheet shows the same place and the song resumes from it, not from the start

- **Scenario:** A call comes first
- **Given:** the song is playing, or a Larry call is live
- **When:** I start a call, or tap play on the song
- **Then:** starting the call pauses the song where it is; with the call live the song does not play and its sheet says it waits for the call to end

- **Scenario:** Scrub and restart
- **Given:** the song's sheet is open
- **When:** I drag the scrubber to the last chorus, or tap restart
- **Then:** the song carries on from where I let go (still playing, or still paused), or plays from the start

- **Scenario:** The small player
- **Given:** the song is playing or paused partway and I closed its sheet
- **When:** I look at the home screen
- **Then:** a small player sits in the bottom-left corner with the song's place and play/pause; tapping it opens the sheet, its ✕ stops the song and it goes away, and it goes away by itself when the song ends

- **Scenario:** The song on Suno
- **Given:** the eulogy post embeds a Suno song
- **When:** I tap *Open on Suno* in the song's sheet
- **Then:** that song opens on Suno (the app if installed, else the browser), and the log names the song and that it came from the post

- **Scenario:** Offline
- **Given:** the phone cannot reach the blog
- **When:** I tap *Open on Suno*
- **Then:** the song found last time opens; if none was ever found, the eulogy post opens and the screen says the song could not be found

- **Scenario:** The post and recent changes
- **Given:** the home screen
- **When:** I tap *Eulogy*, and later *Recent*
- **Then:** idvork.in/eulogy and idvork.in/recent open in the browser

---

### User Story 138:

- **Summary:** The eulogy song plays at its own speed, in the car too
- **Issues:** [#370](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/370)
- **Status:** implemented in [d0a1353](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d0a1353) (the session set before the player is prepared, a player prepared at another sample rate replaced at the same place, and the rate, route and any clock drift in the log) and [4ff9f1b](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/4ff9f1b) with the review fix after it (a song that will not load, or will not start, lets the session go so other audio comes back); verified by `just native-lint`, and the app compiled in the simulator build at 3106eb2 (2026-10-18 build turn); the car on the phone is still for Igor to check
- **Spec:** [native Eulogy](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-native-eulogy-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** who plays his eulogy song while driving, often right after a Larry call or the Cockpit
- **I want to** hear it at its own speed, whatever audio route was there before
- **so that** the song is the song, not a chipmunk that ends in 45 seconds

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Right after the hands-free line
- **Given:** the phone is on the car's hands-free line and the Cockpit was just open
- **When:** I tap *Eulogy song* and listen for a minute
- **Then:** the song sounds as recorded and its clock reads about 1:00, not three times that

### User Story 247:

- **Summary:** A random page of my blog, one tap away
- **Issues:** [#259](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/259)
- **Status:** implemented in [456463e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/456463e); verified on the simulator by `EulogyUITests` (Random brings Safari forward, 2026-10-11); the phone not yet
- **Spec:** [native Eulogy](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-native-eulogy-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** whose blog has years of posts he no longer remembers writing
- **I want to** open a random page of it from the home screen
- **so that** I reread something I'd forgotten without choosing it

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A random page
- **Given:** the home screen, online
- **When:** I tap *Random*
- **Then:** idvork.in/random opens in the browser and shows a page of the blog the blog picked; tapping again later usually lands somewhere else

- **Scenario:** Like any launcher
- **Given:** a phone that already has its own order of launchers
- **When:** this build arrives
- **Then:** *Random* shows at the end until I move or hide it from Settings

### User Story 465:

- **Summary:** Holding Random offers the blog's topics
- **Issues:** [#392](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/392)
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [765ffa1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/765ffa1); verified by `HoldChoicesTests` (host: the eight choices in order) and `HoldPopoverUITests.testTheRandomPopoverOffersTheTopics` (simulator); the tick and the look on the phone not yet
- **Spec:** [Press and hold a tile: a popover of drawn icons](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-press-and-hold-popovers-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** whose blog has years of posts on many subjects
- **I want to** press and hold the Random tile and see the topics as small tiles
- **so that** I can ask for one subject without leaving the home screen

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The topics popover
- **Given:** the home screen
- **When:** I press and hold *Random*
- **Then:** a popover pointing at the tile offers Anything, AI, Tech, Family, Health, Mind, Work and Books, each with a picture and its name, Anything first, and the log has the popover opening

### User Story 466:

- **Summary:** A topic opens the blog's random link for that topic
- **Issues:** [#392](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/392)
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [765ffa1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/765ffa1); verified by `BlogLinksTests` (host: each topic's link) and `HoldPopoverUITests.testTheRandomPopoverOffersTheTopics` (simulator: AI brings the browser forward); the post being on that topic needs the blog's change (story 468)
- **Spec:** [Press and hold a tile: a popover of drawn icons](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-press-and-hold-popovers-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** whose blog has years of posts on many subjects
- **I want to** choose a topic from the Random popover
- **so that** the blog picks a post on that subject

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Choosing AI
- **Given:** the Random popover is open
- **When:** I tap *AI*
- **Then:** idvork.in/random?topic=ai opens in the browser, the popover closes, and the log has `open_random` with `from: home_popover` and `topic: ai`

---

### User Story 467:

- **Summary:** A plain tap on Random stays random from everything
- **Issues:** [#392](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/392)
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [765ffa1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/765ffa1); verified by `BlogLinksTests` (host: Anything is the tile's own link) and `EulogyUITests.testBlogLaunchersLeaveTheApp` (simulator: the tap still opens the browser)
- **Spec:** [Press and hold a tile: a popover of drawn icons](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-press-and-hold-popovers-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** whose blog has years of posts on many subjects
- **I want to** tap Random, or choose Anything from its popover
- **so that** the quick way still surprises me with any post

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Tap or Anything
- **Given:** the home screen
- **When:** I tap *Random*, or hold it and tap *Anything*
- **Then:** idvork.in/random opens in the browser with no topic in the link

---

### User Story 468:

- **Summary:** A topic the blog does not know still lands on a post
- **Issues:** [#392](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/392)
- **Status:** native app only: the app's half implemented in [765ffa1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/765ffa1), which needs no change when the blog ships; the blog's half is not implemented (a PR to idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io). Checked 2026-11-03 by reading the live page and its script: idvork.in/random?topic=ai answers 200, reads no topic and picks from every post
- **Spec:** [Press and hold a tile: a popover of drawn icons](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-press-and-hold-popovers-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** whose blog has years of posts on many subjects
- **I want to** choose a topic before the blog has learned topics
- **so that** nothing breaks while the two halves ship apart, and the choices start working by themselves

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The blog ignores the topic
- **Given:** the blog does not read the topic in the link
- **When:** I choose *AI* from the Random popover
- **Then:** the browser lands on a random post drawn from everything, the app shows no error, and it cannot tell the topic was ignored

---

### User Story 469:

- **Summary:** VoiceOver reaches every topic
- **Issues:** [#392](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/392)
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [765ffa1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/765ffa1), by the same tile actions as stories 222-225; only the phone can show VoiceOver, not yet checked
- **Spec:** [Press and hold a tile: a popover of drawn icons](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-press-and-hold-popovers-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As someone** whose blog has years of posts on many subjects
- **I want to** reach each topic from the Random tile's actions with VoiceOver on
- **so that** a topic never depends on a press and hold

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** VoiceOver
- **Given:** VoiceOver is on and *Random* is focused
- **When:** I choose the *Family* action
- **Then:** idvork.in/random?topic=family opens in the browser

---

### User Story 228:

- **Summary:** A link opens a board, or the boards
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [f37d267](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f37d267); verified on the simulator (a board no device has, against the fake Cockpit, stays on the boards with the problem) and by host tests (the link's parsing); a board that comes down from iCloud through the link, not yet
- **Issues:** [#603](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/603)
- **Spec:** [Native links](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-native-links-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** someone holding a link to one of my whiteboards
- **I want to** open it and be on that board as it is now
- **so that** I never read an old drawing as the current one

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A link to a board
- **Given:** I have a `grabbernative://whiteboard?board=<id>` link
- **When:** I open it
- **Then:** iCloud is asked first and that board opens as it is now; a board that can't be opened leaves me on the boards with a copyable problem saying why

### User Story 460:

- **Summary:** Hold a tile and open its screen in a new window on the iPad
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [cc011df](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cc011df); verified on the iPad simulator (a window opened and closed by `GRABBER_WINDOW`: `window` open, appear, close, gone); the ledger and what a hold offers by `WindowLedgerTests`, on the host. The hold itself and the windows side by side are for the iPad, and so is opening a window after another has closed.
- **Issues:** [#634](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/634)
- **Spec:** [Windows on the iPad](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-ipad-windows-design.md)

- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [cc011df](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cc011df); verified on the iPad simulator (the boards up at home left before their window opened). The Cockpit's page moving is for the iPad.
- **Issues:** [#634](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/634)
- **Spec:** [Windows on the iPad](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-ipad-windows-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor with the Cockpit up at home
- **I want to** give it a window without reloading it
- **so that** its page and what's on it come along

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** It was showing at home
- **Given:** the home window shows the Cockpit
- **When:** another window asks for the Cockpit in a window
- **Then:** it leaves the home window first and the page comes along as it was

---

### User Story 472:

- **Summary:** A card already in a window comes forward without starting a drill or a count
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [cc011df](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cc011df) and its review fix; not verified by a run: only a hold with the card in a window reaches it, which is for the iPad.

### User Story 463:

- **Summary:** A second window leaves a call alone
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [cc011df](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cc011df); verified on the iPad simulator (a call on the fake bridge, synthetic audio, with a board's window opened and closed: it ran to its hang-up, ended `stopped`, not `badly`, and the bridge saw `stt_stop` and `stop`).
- **Issues:** [#634](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/634)

- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [df9b8ac](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/df9b8ac); verified on an iPhone simulator (the home window and Places, no `title` line in the log).
- **Issues:** [#661](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/661)
- **Spec:** [Windows on the iPad](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-ipad-windows-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor on the iPhone
- **I want to** have the phone stay as it was
- **so that** the iPad's window names cost the phone nothing

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Moving between screens on a phone
- **Given:** the app is on an iPhone, which has one window
- **When:** I open and close any screen
- **Then:** the app sets no name on the window

### User Story 580:

- **Summary:** One command opens the app on the Mac
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [e171012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e171012a); verified on Igor's Mac, ad hoc: the app opens in a window with the iPad's layout and no crash report through every launch; the recipe built and opened it, with no Cockpit address.
- **Issues:** [#638](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/638)
- **Spec:** [Grabber Native on the Mac](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-native-mac-app-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor at his Mac
- **I want to** run the same app there as a real Mac app
- **so that** chat and the whiteboard are in a window beside my other work

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Starting it
- **Given:** a checkout of the repo on a Mac
- **When:** I run the Mac recipe
- **Then:** the app builds with no signing identity and opens in a window of its own

---

### User Story 581:

- **Summary:** Each screen a Mac can run comes up on the Mac
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [e171012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e171012a); verified on Igor's Mac, ad hoc, by launch link and session log, with a picture of each screen: home, Today, the timer (cues played, muted), breathing (cues played, muted), Places, the Cockpit, the card, Chat, the whiteboard and a call. Drawing with a mouse is not verified: it needs a person.
- **Issues:** [#638](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/638)
- **Spec:** [Grabber Native on the Mac](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-native-mac-app-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor at his Mac
- **I want to** open any home tile
- **so that** a tile either does its work or tells me why it can't

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Opening a tile
- **Given:** the app is open on the Mac
- **When:** I open any main screen
- **Then:** it comes up, and the app keeps running

### User Story 582:

- **Summary:** A Mac build reaches my Cockpit by itself, and a test launch can keep away from it
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [e171012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e171012a); host tests (`ChatCockpitTests`), and verified on Igor's Mac: no connection to the real Cockpit's address in any launch, watched every half second; the chat list, the Cockpit page and a call each said why. The Cockpit page's reason then moved into its copyable error, with no load attempted: not yet built or seen on a Mac.; [#680](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/680), connecting by default: [dd827e96](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/dd827e96); host tests (`ChatCockpitTests`), and verified on Igor's Mac, ad hoc, with no address named: chat read his 125 threads from his Cockpit and logged no `no_address`.
- **Issues:** [#638](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/638), [#680](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/680)
- **Spec:** [Grabber Native on the Mac](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-native-mac-app-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor, whose Mac is on the tailnet
- **I want** the Mac build to reach my Cockpit with nothing to set, as my phone does
- **so that** chat works as soon as it opens, while a test launch can still stay out of my threads

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** No address named
- **Given:** a Mac build launched with no Cockpit address
- **When:** I open chat
- **Then:** my threads load from my Cockpit, with no error about an address

- **Scenario:** A test launch named nowhere
- **Given:** a Mac build launched with the address named nowhere
- **When:** chat, the Cockpit page, the usage strip, a call and the archive all try to run
- **Then:** nothing reaches the real Cockpit, and what is on screen says copyably why

### User Story 583:

- **Summary:** Named, a Mac build's chat goes to that Cockpit
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [e171012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e171012a); verified on Igor's Mac against the stand-in: a message written in a thread reached it, its reply showed, and the outbox emptied.; [#680](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/680), connecting by default: [dd827e96](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/dd827e96); host tests (`ChatCockpitTests`), and verified on Igor's Mac, ad hoc, with no address named: chat read his 125 threads from his Cockpit and logged no `no_address`.
- **Issues:** [#638](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/638)
- **Spec:** [Grabber Native on the Mac](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-native-mac-app-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor at his Mac
- **I want to** name a Cockpit when I start the app
- **so that** chat works there, against the stand-in or the real one

#### Acceptance Criteria:

### User Story 584:

- **Summary:** Places says a Mac doesn't track in the background
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [e171012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e171012a); built for the Mac and the screen opened on Igor's Mac, its log clean. macOS's location prompt was left unanswered, so a location fix is not verified.
- **Issues:** [#638](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/638)
- **Spec:** [Grabber Native on the Mac](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-native-mac-app-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor looking at Places on the Mac
- **I want** no switch that promises a trail a Mac can't record
- **so that** the screen is honest about what it does here

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The tracking section on a Mac
- **Given:** Places is open on the Mac
- **When:** I look at the tracking section
- **Then:** a line says a Mac doesn't record in the background, where a phone has the switch

### User Story 585:

- **Summary:** The timer and breathing run on a Mac with no Live Activity
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [e171012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e171012a); verified on Igor's Mac by launch hook and session log: a timer ran through its count-in and into its first round, its cues playing muted, and a breathing session ran to its finish, with no error. The Mac build has no Live Activity code to call.
- **Issues:** [#638](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/638)
- **Spec:** [Grabber Native on the Mac](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-native-mac-app-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor timing a set at my desk
- **I want** the timer to run in its window
- **so that** the card a Mac doesn't have is no failure

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A session on the Mac
- **Given:** the Gym Timer or Box breathing is open on the Mac
- **When:** I start a session
- **Then:** it runs to its end in the window, and nothing reports a missing card

### User Story 586:

- **Summary:** With no iCloud a Mac build's boards stay on the Mac
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [e171012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e171012a); verified on Igor's Mac, ad hoc: the boards list says iCloud is out of reach, a board opens, a problem report saves on the Mac, and nothing crashes. A signed Mac build, which would have iCloud, has not been built.
- **Issues:** [#638](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/638)
- **Spec:** [Grabber Native on the Mac](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-native-mac-app-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As** Igor running the build with no signing identity
- **I want** iCloud's absence to be a line and not a crash
- **so that** the rest of the app is still there

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Opening the boards
- **Given:** a Mac build with no iCloud
- **When:** I open the whiteboard
- **Then:** the list says boards stay on this device, and a board opens
