# Calling Larry: the Call and Cockpit tabs

Talking to Larry from the phone — a call that survives the lock, the dashboard in a tab, and the evidence when a call goes wrong.

Part of the [user stories](README.md); persona and format are described there.

---

### User Story 080:

- **Summary:** A Larry call keeps going when the phone locks or goes in a pocket
- **Status:** implemented in [b8d45ca](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b8d45ca), [c1600f0](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c1600f0); verified by `callSession.test.ts` and on the phone (daily calls); native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599); verified by `just native-test` (`CallSession*Tests`) and `just native-test-sim` (a call to the fake bridge, [9939b6a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/9939b6a)); the lock is the phone still to be checked by Igor; native no-sound fix [d9c1fd1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d9c1fd1) (#146: the player reconnected when the mic finds the engine stopped) verified on the phone by Igor, 2026-10-05; #186 [326396a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/326396a) (the silent-mixer check waits for audio in hand 1.5 s; a failed reopen retries at 0.5, 1 and 2 s, then says the audio stopped) verified by `CallSilentMixerTests` (host, the phone's own timings) and the simulator build; on the phone not yet

- **Issues:** [#136](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/136) (native: the bridge refused the native socket, which sent no Origin), #146, [#186](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/186) (a needless reopen that failed left the call silent both ways), [#199](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/199), [#198](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/198)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client walking to school with the phone in a pocket
- **I want to** keep talking after the screen locks, the app goes to the background, or I switch tabs
- **so that** a call is a conversation, not a screen I have to keep lit

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The phone locks mid-call
- **Given:** a call is live on the Call tab and Tony is talking
- **and Given:** the phone's auto-lock is set to 30 seconds
- **When:** I press the side button and keep talking to Larry for two minutes with the screen dark
- **Then:** Larry answers every time, and on unlock the captions include everything said while locked and the timer is continuous

- **Issues:** [#74](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/74) the ask; [#73](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/73) subsumed

---

### User Story 081:

- **Summary:** Call Larry with one tap, and see the phone calling the way the Phone app does
- **Status:** implemented in [b8d45ca](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b8d45ca), [fac48db](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/fac48db), [b15175c](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b15175c); verified by `CallScreen.test.tsx` and on the phone; native app: [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599), the ring still under Reduce Motion; verified by `just native-test-sim` and a simulator screenshot; the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client opening the Call tab
- **I want to** tap Call Larry and watch the phone place the call
- **so that** the first five seconds of every call feel like a call, not a debug screen

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Placing a call on a fresh install
- **Given:** the Call tab is open and nothing has been remembered yet
- **When:** I tap Call Larry
- **Then:** a ring pulses around a handset under *Calling Larry…* and *ElevenLabs*, the words "connecting" and "bridge" appear nowhere, and within about five seconds the line reads *live* with the timer running and Tony greeting me

---

### User Story 082:

- **Summary:** One compact call line, with mute, restart and hang-up as small icons
- **Status:** implemented in [fac48db](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/fac48db), [e858a9d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e858a9d); verified by `CallScreen.test.tsx` and on the phone; native app: [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599); verified by a simulator screenshot of the live call line; the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client reading captions on a live call
- **I want to** have the controls out of the way on the status line
- **so that** the transcript gets the screen instead of three big buttons

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Controls on a live call
- **Given:** a call is live
- **When:** I look at the top of the screen
- **Then:** one line reads *live · 1:17 · ElevenLabs · Igor* on the left with three small icons on the right — mute, restart (↻), a red handset — each answering a tap in a 44 pt square, and the captions run down to the tab bar with nothing under them

- **Issues:** [#90](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/90) the calling state and round buttons; [#96](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/96) folding them into the line

---

### User Story 083:

- **Summary:** The voice level is the mute
- **Status:** implemented in [fac48db](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/fac48db), [8a0a09e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8a0a09e); verified by `CallScreen.test.tsx` and on the phone; native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599); verified by `just native-test` (mute and level tests); the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client wondering whether my microphone is working
- **I want to** glance at one control that moves with my voice and mutes when tapped
- **so that** "is my mic live" and "shut it off" are the same glance and the same thumb

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Muting mid-call
- **Given:** a call is live and the disc in the voice control swells as I speak
- **When:** I tap the control
- **Then:** it dims, a red slash crosses the microphone, the disc freezes, the live line reads *muted*, nothing I say produces an Igor caption, and Larry does not hang up on the silence

---

### User Story 084:

- **Summary:** See what the recognizer is hearing me say, big, before it is sent
- **Status:** implemented in [4715141](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/4715141); verified by `CallScreen.test.tsx` and on the phone; native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599); verified by `just native-test` (caption tests) and `just native-test-sim` (the fake bridge's partial and final become one Igor row); the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client talking on a noisy street
- **I want to** watch my words appear large as they are recognised
- **so that** a misheard word shows up while there is still time to say it again

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A sentence is recognised
- **Given:** a call is live and the box under the call line reads *listening…*
- **When:** I say a sentence slowly
- **Then:** the words appear in the box in large type as they are recognised, and when the sentence is sent to Larry the box returns to *listening…* and the sentence is one *Igor* row in the transcript below ([story 303](#user-story-303))

---

### User Story 303:

- **Summary:** See the moment my sentence is sent to Larry, without waiting for his reply
- **Status:** STATUS_303
- **Issues:** [#467](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/467)
- **Spec:** [Native call — the live line](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client on a Direct call, where Larry can think for seconds before he speaks
- **I want to** see each sentence leave the live line and sit in the transcript marked *sent* the moment it goes to Larry
- **so that** I know what he has, and what I say next is plainly a new sentence rather than more of the last one

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Two sentences sent before Larry answers
- **Given:** a live call, on Direct or ElevenLabs, with the live line reading *listening…*
- **When:** I say a sentence, it is sent to Larry, and I say a second one before he answers
- **Then:** the first sentence is an *Igor* row marked *sent* as soon as it is sent, the second builds in a fresh live line and becomes a second *Igor* row marked *sent* — two rows, neither shown twice — and when Larry answers both *sent* marks go

---

### User Story 085:

- **Summary:** Pick the voice that answers — Tony or my own clone
- **Status:** implemented in [3d0c38d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/3d0c38d); verified by `callVoices.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599), the pick remembered in the settings table under the old app's key; verified by `just native-test` (voice tests); the phone still to be checked by Igor. #417: each voice's model from the Cockpit's recommendation in [1c65923](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/1c65923); verified by the call host tests (the recommendation cache and the start frame) and the full `just test`, and the app compiles on the simulator; a call on the phone not yet. #428: the recommendation request gets an eight-second budget in [67247cc](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/67247cc); verified by `just test` (host) and the simulator build; on the phone not yet.

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who has heard his own cloned voice perform
- **I want to** choose Igor instead of Tony before a call
- **so that** the next call answers in my voice on the model that makes it worth hearing

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A call as Igor
- **Given:** ElevenLabs is the backend and the devices fold shows a *Voice* row with Tony highlighted
- **When:** I pick Igor, fold the pickers, and tap Call Larry
- **Then:** the devices line ends *· Igor*, the call line reads *live · 0:03 · ElevenLabs · Igor*, the voice that answers is my own on the Cockpit’s recommended model (or the bridge’s choice until recommendations arrive), the last good recommendation works offline and survives relaunch, fresh recommendations avoid a refetch, expired recommendations revalidate without delaying the call, a slow cellular recommendation has eight seconds to arrive and is saved for subsequent calls even after this call starts, and the pick survives a force-quit

- **Issues:** [#98](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/98), [#417](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/417), [#428](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/428)

---

### User Story 086:

- **Summary:** Choose the microphone and speaker by name, folded away until needed
- **Issues:** [#293](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/293)
- **Status:** implemented in [b8d45ca](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b8d45ca), [c1600f0](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c1600f0), [0a3812b](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/0a3812b); verified by `callDevices.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: the devices line is a menu during a call (#293): [3bd0779](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/3bd0779), verified by `CallDevicesTests` (host: Automatic named after the live microphone, the one in use checked, outputs in the audio bridge's order); picking on the phone not yet

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who just put AirPods in
- **I want to** move the call's microphone and output mid-call, or let a plugged-in USB mic take over
- **so that** the call follows the hardware I am actually wearing

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Pickers mid-call
- **Given:** a call is live on the built-in microphone and speaker
- **and Given:** AirPods Pro are paired
- **When:** I open the devices line and pick *AirPods Pro* as the microphone
- **Then:** within two seconds the devices line names AirPods Pro, the call continues, and my next sentence is captioned

---

### User Story 087:

- **Summary:** The first call after launch works like every other call
- **Status:** implemented in [62953e1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/62953e1), [ae01372](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/ae01372), [7db050d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7db050d); verified by `callSession.test.ts`, `callWatchdog.test.ts` and on the phone — the silent first call still recurs; native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599), voice processing on from prepare every call; verified by `just native-test` (no-first-frame and zeros tests); the phone still to be checked by Igor; the zero-run rearm's evidence and its edges (#364): [6cd1ff0](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/6cd1ff0), [2bba05e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/2bba05e), [387088f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/387088f), [b02aeca](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b02aeca), [00153f0](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/00153f0) (the heal says what the mic and the playback held, *audio back* is logged once the restart has finished, and a recovery finishing after the hang-up logs and reports nothing for the ended call), verified by `just native-test` (`CallSessionZerosTests`, `testAProbeRearmThatFailsAfterTheHangUpIsIgnored`); the simulator in the next build turn; the 1.5-second watch narrowed to a built-in recorder with a valid sample rate, Bluetooth and a zero rate waiting 10 s (#423, story 204): [c841779](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c841779), [538d3f1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/538d3f1), verified by `just test` (host, the no-first-frame tests) and the simulator build

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client placing the day's first call
- **I want to** be heard on the first try
- **so that** I never need a second tap to start talking

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A microphone that never delivers
- **Given:** the app was force-quit and relaunched
- **and Given:** the built-in recorder has a valid sample rate but produces no buffer for a second and a half
- **When:** I tap Call Larry and say a sentence as soon as Tony greets me
- **Then:** the call's audio is torn down and brought back up on its own, and if it is still silent the call redials itself once on the same backend — *Calling Larry…* briefly, then *live* — without a tap, and my sentence is captioned; if I hang up while a recovery is still finishing, the ended call shows no new problem

- **Issues:** [#88](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/88) fixed; [#95](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/95) open — the bridge still receives zero mic frames on some first calls; [#364](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/364) open — on the simulator the mic gives a silent first second, and the heal's restart drops queued playback; the heal now logs the evidence

---

### User Story 088:

- **Summary:** Audio that stops mid-call heals itself, in either direction
- **Status:** implemented in [7db050d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7db050d), [9c50345](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/9c50345); verified by `callSession.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599) (tap re-armed up to three times, the graph rebuilt on an interruption or a configuration change); verified by `just native-test` (`CallWatchdogTests`); the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose microphone went quiet after the route settled
- **I want to** have the call notice and fix it
- **so that** a dead direction costs a short gap, not a hang-up and a redial

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The microphone stalls mid-call
- **Given:** a call is live and captions are flowing
- **When:** a route change kills the microphone tap (plugging and unplugging a USB mic)
- **Then:** within about two seconds Diagnostics shows *mic stalled … → re-arming (1/3)*, my next sentence is captioned, and no error is on screen

---

### User Story 089:

- **Summary:** Tony's greeting is heard in full, every call
- **Status:** implemented in [7db050d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7db050d), [9c50345](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/9c50345); verified by `callSession.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599) (`clock_running` with after_ms before the first frame; reopened once after 2 s); verified by `just native-test-sim` (real audio: the clock ran and the bridge's second of PCM was scheduled); the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client answering on speaker
- **I want to** hear Tony's first sentence, not the second half of it
- **so that** the call does not open with "sorry, what?"

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The speaker is still waking up
- **Given:** a call has just gone *live* on the phone's speaker
- **When:** Larry's first frames arrive before the output clock is running
- **Then:** they are held until the clock runs, Diagnostics shows *output clock running after N ms* before the first frame is scheduled, and the whole greeting plays

---

### User Story 090:

- **Summary:** When Tony's audio is not arriving, read him instead
- **Status:** implemented in [7db050d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7db050d); verified by `callSession.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3); verified by `just native-test` (audio not arriving test); the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client on a call where the words come and the sound does not
- **I want to** be told the bridge is not sending audio and read Tony's transcript meanwhile
- **so that** a starved socket is named, not blamed on my speaker, and the conversation can limp on

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A starved socket
- **Given:** a call is live and Tony's captions keep arriving
- **When:** no audio has come down the socket for five seconds
- **Then:** the screen says *Tony's audio is not arriving from the bridge*, the captions keep updating, and the banner clears the moment audio resumes

- **Issues:** [#105](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/105)

---

### User Story 091:

- **Summary:** Restart a bad call with one tap
- **Status:** implemented in [e858a9d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/e858a9d); verified by `callSession.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599); verified by `just native-test` (restart test); the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client on a call with echo or a stuck consult
- **I want to** end it and dial again without visiting the picker
- **so that** the fix for a call that went bad is one thumb, and the evidence of the bad call is kept

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Restarting a live call
- **Given:** a call is live on ElevenLabs
- **When:** I tap ↻ on the call line
- **Then:** the call ends with *stopped*, *Calling Larry…* shows at once on the same backend, then *live*, and Diagnostics afterwards holds both calls separated by a rule

---

### User Story 092:

- **Summary:** The call tells Larry where I am
- **Status:** implemented in [b88f34e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b88f34e); verified by `callLocation.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: wired once Places shipped (#107): [23ff3f2](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/23ff3f2), verified by `CallLocationTests` (host); the Diagnostics line on a real call in the next build turn; the start and location frames are ported and tested in `CallSessionLocationTests`; the log rounds an off-place fix (bead byo): [1f90c41](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/1f90c41), verified by `CallLocationTests` (host)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client calling from the walk to school
- **I want to** have my position — a known place's name when there is one — go up with the call and again when I move
- **so that** Larry knows where I am without me saying so

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A call placed at home
- **Given:** location permission is granted and Home is a known place
- **When:** I tap Call Larry and then walk out of the Home radius
- **Then:** Diagnostics shows *location: Home (±… m)* before or shortly after *live*, one more location line reaches the log within a minute of leaving, and standing still sends none; off a known place the log line shows the position to two decimals only

- **Issues:** [#107](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/107) the ask (still open: what Larry does with it is the bridge's)

---

### User Story 093:

- **Summary:** Read the call's log on the phone, with both directions counted
- **Status:** implemented in [b8d45ca](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b8d45ca), [6df0f65](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/6df0f65), [ae01372](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/ae01372), [7db050d](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7db050d); verified by `callLog.test.ts` and on the phone (every bug from #88 on was read from it); native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599) — the call's log is the session log, the fold shows this launch's `call_*` events with a rule between calls; verified by `just native-test` (`CallEventLogTests`) and `just native-test-sim` (the bridge received the dump at the hang-up); the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose call just went silent
- **I want to** open Diagnostics and see what the audio session, the microphone and the speaker were doing, for this call and the ones before it
- **so that** a bad call can be explained from the phone without a cable

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Reading a silent call afterwards
- **Given:** a call ended badly, its retry worked, and three more calls followed
- **When:** I open the Diagnostics fold
- **Then:** every call is there, oldest first and separated by rules, each with its start, the *at arm:* line, `mic_ack`, an `rx … KB / … frames · played … of …` line every five seconds and the ending with the final pair — and *Copy diagnostics* copies all of it with the build and roster

- **Issues:** [#106](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/106); [#92](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/92) evidence must survive a retry

---

### User Story 094:

- **Summary:** A troubled call uploads its log as a private gist on its own
- **Status:** implemented in [7504fa6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7504fa6), [8a0a09e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8a0a09e), [670084c](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/670084c); verified by `gistUpload.test.ts` and on the phone (a device build: the Keychain is native); native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599), the token entered under Diagnostics uploads on the native home screen; verified by `just native-test` (`GistTests`, the trouble rule in `CallEventLogTests`); a real gist is the phone still to be checked by Igor; the Swift-native app no longer uploads gists (2026-10-11): it files an automatic report instead, [story 248](#user-story-248)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who just hung up on a call that went wrong
- **I want to** have the log already at a URL on my clipboard
- **so that** the next paste into Telegram is the evidence, and I never copy a dump by hand

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A connection is lost mid-call
- **Given:** a GitHub token with the `gist` scope is saved in Settings and *Upload after a troubled call* is on
- **When:** the bridge dies mid-call and the call ends with *connection lost*
- **Then:** a secret gist named for the date and *troubled call* is created with the delete-me note at the top and the same text *Copy diagnostics* gives, its URL is on the clipboard and shown under the Diagnostics buttons, and a clean call afterwards creates nothing

- **Issues:** [#92](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/92)

---

### User Story 095:

- **Summary:** Delete what the phone uploaded, and never pile up gists
- **Status:** implemented in [7504fa6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7504fa6), [8a0a09e](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8a0a09e), [670084c](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/670084c); verified by `gistUpload.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: [f6092a3](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f6092a3), [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599); verified by `just native-test` (`GistTests`: prune, retire, already gone); the phone still to be checked by Igor; the Swift-native app no longer uploads gists (2026-10-11): it files an automatic report instead, [story 248](#user-story-248)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose call transcripts are sitting in secret gists
- **I want to** clear them from Settings once they have been read
- **so that** the evidence is short-lived and nothing accumulates on my account

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Deleting after three uploads
- **Given:** the app has uploaded three gists and one was already deleted on the laptop
- **When:** I tap *Delete uploaded diagnostics (3)* in Settings
- **Then:** it reports *deleted 2 of 3 — 1 already gone*, the count reads 0, the two are gone from GitHub, and only gists this app created were ever touched

---

### User Story 248:

- **Summary:** A call that went wrong files a report on its own, and the Mac files the issue
- **Status:** implemented in [0a56f3a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/0a56f3a) (the report, the gist gone) and [9fd7f3b](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/9fd7f3b) (the smoke check: a dropped call reports once, a second is skipped); verified on the simulator by `just native-test-sim` (2026-10-11: a clean call files none, a dropped call files one with call-log.txt, a second after a relaunch is skipped; smoke-check fix [7c4ed4b](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/7c4ed4b)); the listener filing one and a real troubled call on the phone not yet
- **Spec:** [Swift-native app](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who just hung up on a call that went wrong
- **I want to** have its log reach a GitHub issue without copying, uploading or a token on the phone
- **so that** the evidence of every troubled call is there when I sit down at the Mac, and nothing private is posted before then

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A connection is lost mid-call
- **Given:** the native app on the phone
- **When:** the bridge dies mid-call and the call ends with *connection lost*
- **Then:** the phone saves a report on its own, with the call's log, the reason and this launch's log named, and no screenshot or note; nothing is uploaded from the phone

- **Scenario:** The Mac picks it up
- **Given:** a report saved after a troubled call
- **When:** the Mac's listener next reaches the phone
- **Then:** it files one GitHub issue titled *Automatic report: call_trouble* with the call's log, once

- **Scenario:** A call that keeps failing
- **Given:** a report was saved for a troubled call less than ten minutes ago, even across a relaunch
- **When:** another call ends in trouble
- **Then:** no second report is saved, and the log says it was skipped; a clean call saves nothing

- **Scenario:** A very long call
- **Given:** the call's log is longer than the report's 5 MB
- **When:** the report is saved
- **Then:** it keeps the newest lines, from a line boundary, and the log says it was cut

- **Scenario:** No gist left behind
- **Given:** the home screen's Settings tile
- **When:** I look for *Diagnostics uploads*
- **Then:** it is gone: no token to enter and nothing to delete; *Copy diagnostics* on the call still copies the log

---

### User Story 096:

- **Summary:** The Cockpit dashboard lives in a tab and keeps its place
- **Status:** implemented in [a11f583](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a11f583), [4e12d89](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/4e12d89); verified by `CockpitScreen.test.tsx` and on the phone. Native: [63a012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/63a012a) (a screen kept for the launch, story 200); verified by `CockpitBridgeTests` (host) and the `cockpit:` checks in `sim-smoke.sh` (simulator) and a simulator screenshot of the tailnet page; on the phone: not yet

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client answering a decision on the phone between errands
- **I want to** open the tailnet-only Cockpit as a tab and come back to it exactly as I left it
- **so that** the dashboard is part of the app, not a Safari tab to hunt for

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Leaving and returning
- **Given:** the Cockpit tab has loaded, I have scrolled down and expanded a row
- **When:** I switch to the Today tab and back
- **Then:** the dashboard is at the same scroll position with the same row expanded, with no reload flash and no header above it

---

### User Story 097:

- **Summary:** The Cockpit page gets real microphones and outputs, and knows it is inside the app
- **Status:** implemented in [19533fc](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/19533fc), [f8d2f3a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/f8d2f3a); verified by `audioBridge.test.ts`, `cockpitClient.test.ts` and on the phone. Native: [63a012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/63a012a); verified by `CockpitBridgeTests` (host) and the `cockpit:` checks in `sim-smoke.sh` (simulator) (a device list delivered and acknowledged, the tag on the address) and the real tailnet page asking the native bridge for its roster on the simulator; real headsets on the phone: not yet

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client using the Cockpit's own call from the tab
- **I want to** see the same microphone and output pickers I have on the laptop, and have Larry's records say the call came from the app
- **so that** the web view is not a second-class place to call from

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Pickers in the web view
- **Given:** the Cockpit tab is open on its Call tab with AirPods paired
- **When:** I open the microphone dropdown
- **Then:** it lists *iPhone Microphone* and *AirPods Pro* by the names iOS gives them, the output dropdown offers Automatic, Speaker and the headset, and the page's address carries `client=context-grabber` with the build

- **Issues:** [#78](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/78)

### User Story 098:

- **Summary:** A call from a link, a Shortcut, the widget, or the Cockpit page's own ☎ lands on the native Call tab
- **Status:** implemented in [cef19fc](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cef19fc), [8d35bb6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8d35bb6), [a902080](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a902080), [b10e8d5](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b10e8d5); verified by `deepLink.test.ts`, `audioBridge.test.ts` and on the phone. Native: [63a012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/63a012a) parses `call.start` / `call.focus` and hands the page's `grabber://call` to iOS, which opens Context Grabber's Call tab until the native call lands; verified by `BridgeParseTests`, `CockpitPageTests` (host); on the phone: not yet
- **Status:** implemented in [cef19fc](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cef19fc), [8d35bb6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8d35bb6), [a902080](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/a902080), [b10e8d5](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/b10e8d5); verified by `deepLink.test.ts`, `audioBridge.test.ts` and on the phone; native app: the Call Larry Shortcut only (story 202); links and the widget wait for step 7

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client on the home screen
- **I want to** reach a live call in one tap from wherever I am, including the Cockpit page's call button
- **so that** there is one call — the one that survives the lock — however I start it

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The page's call button inside the app
- **Given:** the Cockpit tab is open and no call is live
- **When:** I tap the page's ☎
- **Then:** the app switches to the Call tab and the call goes *live* on the remembered backend with no "open in Context Grabber?" prompt and no second microphone; with a call already live the tab is brought forward and the timer did not reset

- **Issues:** [#85](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/85); [#99](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/99)

---

### User Story 099:

- **Summary:** Larry hears about arrivals and workouts as they happen, and can nudge the phone back
- **Status:** not implemented; asks: [#84](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/84)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client arriving at the gym
- **I want to** have the arrival reach Larry without a call, and let Larry send a line to the phone
- **so that** the coaching is live context, not only what I bring to a call

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Arriving at a known place
- **Given:** Kettlebility is a known place and background tracking is on
- **When:** the phone settles inside its radius
- **Then:** Larry's record shows the arrival within a few minutes, and a note Larry sends back appears on the phone

- **Issues:** [#84](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/84) — shape to be discussed first

---

### User Story 200:

- **Summary:** In Grabber Native the Cockpit is a full-screen page from the home screen, and Done keeps it
- **Status:** implemented in [63a012a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/63a012a) (native), the ☎ staying in the app in [d061129](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d061129) (`CockpitCallUITests` on the simulator: one call on the page's backend, the fallback link caught as a duplicate); verified by `CockpitBridgeTests` (host), the `cockpit:` checks in `sim-smoke.sh` and a simulator screenshot of the tailnet page, the bridge test page and the unreachable panel; on the phone: not yet. Back and Cockpit in the footer (#234): [c1c6e53](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c1c6e53); verified by `CockpitBackUITests` on the simulator (a page the stand-in Cockpit opened in place shows Back, Back returns and the button goes, Cockpit returns from two pages deep, Done leaves) and `CockpitCallUITests` still passing
- **Issues:** [#234](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/234)
- **Spec:** [native Cockpit](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-native-cockpit-design.md)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client trying the native app beside Context Grabber
- **I want to** open the Cockpit from the native app's home screen, step back to it, and find the dashboard as I left it
- **so that** the native app carries the decision queue — with the real microphone and output pickers — before it replaces the old one

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Done and back
- **Given:** I opened *Cockpit* on Grabber Native's home screen, scrolled down and expanded a row
- **When:** I tap *Done* in the footer and then *Cockpit* again
- **Then:** the dashboard is at the same place with the row expanded and no loading flash; the page's address carries `client=context-grabber` with the native build, its pickers list the phone's microphones and outputs

- **Scenario:** Back from a page the Cockpit opened
- **Given:** I opened Lavish (or a blog proposal) from the dashboard, and it opened in place
- **When:** I tap *Back* in the footer, or *Cockpit* from a page or two deeper
- **Then:** Back goes one page back and disappears on the dashboard, Cockpit goes straight to the dashboard, *Done* still leaves the Cockpit, and the session log has `cockpit_page`, `cockpit_back` and `cockpit_home` with the addresses

- **Scenario:** The page's ☎ stays in the app
- **Given:** Grabber Native's Cockpit is open and no call is up
- **When:** I tap the page's ☎
- **Then:** the Cockpit steps back and Grabber Native's Call screen comes up with one call starting, on the backend the page asked for; Context Grabber does not open. Tapping ☎ again from the Cockpit during that call brings the same call forward

---

### User Story 201:

- **Summary:** Leave the call screen and come back to the same call
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599); verified by build and the simulator smoke (the call is owned by the app model, the screen only shows it), leaving and returning not exercised by a script; the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who wants to check the timer or report a problem mid-call
- **I want to** close the call screen without ending the call and find it again from the home screen
- **so that** the call is the app's, not a screen I must keep open

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Done mid-call
- **Given:** a call is live in Grabber Native and Tony is talking
- **When:** I tap *Done* and look at the home screen
- **Then:** Tony keeps talking, the Call row reads *live · 0:42 · ElevenLabs · Tony* and counts on, and a tap on it shows the same captions and the same timer, with the session log showing `close_call` and `open_call` and no `call_ended` between them

---

### User Story 202:

- **Summary:** Call Larry from a Shortcut in the native app
- **Status:** native app only: implemented in [d782599](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d782599); verified by build only (Shortcuts cannot run on the simulator from a script); the phone still to be checked by Igor

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client with the Action Button set to a Shortcut
- **I want to** run *Call Larry* from Grabber Native's actions
- **so that** the call that survives the lock is one press away while the native app replaces the old one

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The Shortcut with no call up
- **Given:** Grabber Native is closed and ElevenLabs is the remembered backend
- **When:** I run Grabber Native's *Call Larry* action from the Shortcuts app
- **Then:** the app opens on the call screen and the call goes *live* on ElevenLabs without a tap, the session log shows `open_call` from shortcut and `call_start`, and running it again mid-call brings the call forward without a second `call_start`

---

### User Story 203:

- **Summary:** What is left of Claude's week and of the voice budget, as a strip on the native home screen
- **Status:** implemented in [3da9e54](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/3da9e54) (native); verified by `CockpitUsageTests` (host) and the simulator against the live Cockpit (strip drawn: Week 31%, Fable 13% orange, Voice 3.8h; unreachable Cockpit: no strip, `usage` load ok:false in the log); the refresh ask's Origin checked with curl (403 without, 202 with); on the phone: not yet; the *to spend* nudge [aa054d2](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/aa054d2) verified by `CockpitUsageTests` and a simulator screenshot against the live Cockpit (*28% to spend · resets in 6H*); the thinner card, verified by a simulator screenshot against the live Cockpit: [adfed5a](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/adfed5a)
- **Spec:** [native Cockpit — the usage strip](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-native-cockpit-design.md#the-usage-strip-on-the-home-screen)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who spends Claude and ElevenLabs all week
- **I want to** see how much of the weekly allowance, the current model's allowance and the voice budget is left the moment I open the native app
- **so that** I pace the week without opening the Cockpit, and a call to Larry never dies on an empty voice budget

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A glance at what is left
- **Given:** the phone is on the tailnet and the Cockpit has a usage reading
- **When:** I open Grabber Native
- **Then:** above the rows a thin card, about two lines tall with hairline bars, shows Week, the model and Voice left as bars with their numbers, when the week resets and the pacing verdict; a bar under 20% is orange, under 10% red; a stale reading says its age

- **Scenario:** Quota about to go to waste
- **Given:** the week resets in 13 hours and 31% of it is left
- **When:** I open Grabber Native
- **Then:** the line under the bars starts with *31% to spend* in green; a day earlier, or with under 20% left, it does not

- **Scenario:** Refresh and off the tailnet
- **Given:** the strip is showing
- **When:** I tap it
- **Then:** it says *refreshing…* until Larry has taken a new reading (about a minute) and then shows it; and with Tailscale off the home screen shows no strip and no error

### User Story 204:

- **Summary:** A slow Bluetooth microphone gets time to settle before the call heals
- **Status:** implemented in [c841779](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c841779), [538d3f1](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/538d3f1); verified by `just test` (host, `MicStartupDeadlineTests` and the no-first-frame tests) and the simulator build; a call in the car not yet.
- **Issues:** [#423](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/423)
- **Spec:** [Native call — a microphone that never delivers](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#a-microphone-that-never-delivers)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client calling from the car
- **I want to** let its Bluetooth microphone finish connecting
- **so that** the call's recovery does not keep restarting a microphone that is still waking up

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The car microphone starts slowly
- **Given:** the current route is Bluetooth or the microphone reports a zero sample rate, and no microphone buffer has arrived
- **When:** I call Larry and the microphone takes almost ten seconds after opening to deliver its first buffer
- **Then:** neither a no-buffer audio reset nor a redial interrupts those ten seconds, the first buffer cancels that heal, and Diagnostics record the deadline and reason; if no buffer arrives by ten seconds, the existing reset and one-time redial apply, while a valid built-in or wired microphone keeps its 1.5-second watch

---

### User Story 205:

- **Summary:** Call Direct Larry from the app — my words straight to Larry, his answer in his own voice
- **Status:** implemented in [cfa3db4](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cfa3db4); verified by `just test` (host: `CallWireTests`, `CallSessionTests.testADirectCallNamesTheBackendAndSendsNoVoiceOrModel`, `AppLinkTests`, `CockpitBridgeTests`, `CallSettingsTests`) and on the simulator against the fake bridge (*live · Direct*, Larry's line captioned *Larry*, five backends fitting the row); a real Direct call on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#436](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/436)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Direct Larry](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#direct-larry)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who wants to talk to Larry himself, not a voice model that phones him
- **I want to** pick *Direct* on the Call screen
- **so that** the call reaches the Cockpit's Direct Larry and the conversation is with him

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Placing a Direct call
- **Given:** the Call screen is idle
- **When:** I pick *Direct* and tap Call Larry
- **Then:** the call goes live on the bridge's Direct Larry with its own model and voice, the status line reads *live · … · Direct*, Larry's lines are captioned *Larry*, there is no Voice row, and the next call starts on Direct too

---

### User Story 206:

- **Summary:** Ask for Direct Larry from outside the Call screen
- **Status:** implemented in [cfa3db4](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cfa3db4); verified by `just test` (host: `CallWireTests`, `CallSessionTests.testADirectCallNamesTheBackendAndSendsNoVoiceOrModel`, `AppLinkTests`, `CockpitBridgeTests`, `CallSettingsTests`) and on the simulator against the fake bridge (*live · Direct*, Larry's line captioned *Larry*, five backends fitting the row); a real Direct call on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#436](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/436)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Direct Larry](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#direct-larry)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client starting a call from a link, a shortcut or a Cockpit page
- **I want to** name Direct Larry there
- **so that** the call starts on Direct without my opening the backend row first

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Every way in
- **Given:** an entry point set to Direct: the link `grabbernative://call?via=direct`, the Call Larry shortcut with backend *Direct Larry*, or ☎ on a Cockpit page set to Direct Larry inside the app
- **When:** I use it
- **Then:** the call starts on Direct

---

### User Story 207:

- **Summary:** The other backends keep Tony and the Voice row when Direct joins them
- **Status:** implemented in [cfa3db4](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/cfa3db4); verified by `just test` (host: `CallWireTests`, `CallSessionTests.testADirectCallNamesTheBackendAndSendsNoVoiceOrModel`, `AppLinkTests`, `CockpitBridgeTests`, `CallSettingsTests`) and on the simulator against the fake bridge (*live · Direct*, Larry's line captioned *Larry*, five backends fitting the row); a real Direct call on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#436](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/436)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Direct Larry](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#direct-larry)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who calls through a voice model
- **I want to** keep the call I had before Direct arrived
- **so that** Direct changes nothing about ElevenLabs, Gemini, OpenAI or Drill

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The other backends are unchanged
- **Given:** I picked ElevenLabs (shown as *Eleven* in the row), Gemini, OpenAI or Drill
- **When:** I call
- **Then:** Larry's lines are captioned *Tony* as before and the Voice row is where it was

---

### User Story 208:

- **Summary:** A microphone that fails to open still gets the call's reset and redial
- **Status:** implemented in [40f5d77](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/40f5d77); verified by `just test` (host: `CallSessionMicTests` — a failed open resets then redials, a failed reset still redials, a buffer clears the line — and `ErrorDetailTests`) and the simulator build; whether the reset or the redial recovers from the phone's *unspecified* audio error is not yet seen on the phone
- **Issues:** [#441](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/441) (the phone's audio refused to start, *avfaudio error 2003329396*, and the call sat silent until the bridge hung up)
- **Spec:** [Native call — a microphone that never delivers](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#a-microphone-that-never-delivers)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose phone refuses to start its audio
- **I want to** have the call try its reset and its one redial on its own
- **so that** a call that failed to open the microphone recovers, or says so, instead of sitting silent until the bridge hangs up

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The microphone fails to open
- **Given:** a live call whose microphone failed to open, so the screen says *microphone failed*
- **When:** no microphone buffer arrives within the startup deadline
- **Then:** the call resets its audio once; if the reset fails or still brings no buffer, it redials once; a buffer after the reset clears *microphone failed*; and Diagnostics record the session, route, foreground state, formats and the error's own code for every failed audio start

---

### User Story 209:

- **Summary:** A call that ends *connection lost* leaves the evidence of which network went
- **Status:** implemented in [03563d6](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/03563d6), interfaces in use apart from those available in [d6ba8c4](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/d6ba8c4) (instrumentation only: the cause of the drops is not yet known); verified by `just test` (host: `CallNetworkTests`, `CallSessionConnectingTests.testALostSocketSaysHowLongSinceTheLastFrameInAndOut`) and the simulator build; a dropped call's log on the phone not yet
- **Issues:** [#440](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/440), [#439](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/439) (two calls from home lost their connection seconds in; the log could not say why)
- **Spec:** [Native call — interruptions](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#interruptions)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose call dropped
- **I want to** have the call's log say what the network did
- **so that** the drop can be fixed from evidence instead of a guess

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The connection drops mid-call
- **Given:** a live call
- **When:** the phone's network changes, or the connection to the bridge is lost
- **Then:** Diagnostics hold the network at the call's start and at every change (connected or not, which interfaces the call is using and which are available, metered, Low Data Mode), and the lost line names the error's code, the error underneath it, and the seconds since the last frame in and out; the screen still says *connection lost*

### User Story 210:

- **Summary:** Larry's reply plays clean when the bridge cuts his frames mid-sample
- **Status:** implemented in [8385814](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8385814); verified by `just test` (host: `PCM16StreamTests`); a Direct call on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#442](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/442), [#447](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/447)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Diagnostics](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#diagnostics)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client who heard noise and static on a call whose server-side recording was clean
- **I want to** the phone to read Larry's audio as the stream it is
- **so that** a frame cut mid-sample no longer plays as static

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Larry's reply arrives in frames cut mid-sample
- **Given:** a live call whose bridge sends Larry's audio in frames, some with an odd byte count
- **When:** the reply plays
- **Then:** the reply is heard clean: an odd frame's last byte joins the next frame

---

### User Story 211:

- **Summary:** A call that sounds wrong says why in Diagnostics
- **Status:** implemented in [8385814](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8385814); verified by `just test` (host: `PlaybackWindowTests`, the counters in `CallSessionCountersTests`); a Direct call on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#442](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/442)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Diagnostics](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#diagnostics)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose call sounded wrong
- **I want to** the call's log to say how Larry's frames arrived and played
- **so that** the next bad call carries its own evidence

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** Larry speaks on a live call
- **Given:** a live call
- **When:** Larry's frames arrive
- **Then:** Diagnostics show a playback line every five seconds he spoke with frame count and sizes, odd and dropped frames, underruns and dry time, longest gap and queue depth; the level line names the player, session and hardware rates and the buffer; and the ending line carries the odd-frame and underrun totals

### User Story 212:

- **Summary:** A call's log reaches Larry without the phone
- **Status:** implemented in [8385814](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/8385814); verified by `just test` (host: `CallLogArchiveTests`, the trouble rule in `CallEventLogTests`); its log in the Cockpit's archive after a call on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#442](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/442)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Diagnostics](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#diagnostics)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose call merely sounded wrong
- **I want to** the call's log sent to the Cockpit's archive when the call ends
- **so that** Larry can read the evidence on his box without the phone

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A call ends
- **Given:** a call that reached the bridge's ready
- **When:** the call ends
- **Then:** the call's log is in the Cockpit's archive under the call's bridge session, with a line in Diagnostics saying it was taken

### User Story 213:

- **Summary:** Larry's reply stays clean when the phone's own audio hiccups mid-reply
- **Status:** implemented in [c9ff20c](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c9ff20c), [3d81338](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/3d81338) (a barge-in starts the stream anew even with no player); verified by `just test` (host: `PCM16StreamTests.testASkippedFrameKeepsTheStreamAligned`, `testTheCarryWaitsForTheNextFrameAndNotPastAReset`); a Direct call on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#442](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/442) (Codex on #443)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Diagnostics](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#diagnostics)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose phone rebuilds its audio during a call
- **I want to** the samples after the hiccup to stay aligned
- **so that** a rebuild or a dropped frame never turns the rest of the reply into static

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** The phone's own audio hiccups mid-reply
- **Given:** a reply whose frames are cut mid-sample
- **When:** the phone rebuilds its audio, or a frame arrives with nowhere to play
- **Then:** the samples after it are heard clean, never static: only Larry's next reply starts the stream anew

### User Story 214:

- **Summary:** A call that never heard ready still keeps its own log in the archive
- **Status:** implemented in [c9ff20c](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c9ff20c); verified by `just test` (host: `CallLogArchiveTests.testACallThatNeverHeardReadyTakesAFreshLocalKey`); on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#442](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/442) (Codex on #443)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Diagnostics](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#diagnostics)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose call failed before the bridge was ready
- **I want to** that call's log archived under a key of its own
- **so that** the archive never drops it as another call's copy

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A call that never reached the bridge's ready
- **Given:** a call that never reached the bridge's ready
- **When:** the call ends
- **Then:** its log goes under a key no other call shares

### User Story 215:

- **Summary:** A line too long for an archive record does not cost the rest of the log
- **Status:** implemented in [c9ff20c](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/c9ff20c), [054fbc8](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/054fbc8) and [135439f](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/commit/135439f) (a long field in the header is cut too, Codex on #523); verified by `just test` (host: `CallLogArchiveTests.testALongLineIsCutUntilItsRecordFitsTheArchivesBytes`, `testALongProblemInTheHeaderIsCutUntilTheHeaderFits`); on the phone not yet.
- **Issues:** [#442](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/442) (Codex on #443)
- **Spec:** [Native call — Diagnostics](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-native-call-screen-design.md#diagnostics)

#### Use Case:
- **As a** Larry's client whose call carried a long caption or tool answer
- **I want to** that line cut to fit an archive record
- **so that** the archive keeps the rest of the call's log

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** A line longer than an archive record holds
- **Given:** a call whose log has a line, or whose ending or problem in the header, longer than an archive record holds
- **When:** the call ends
- **Then:** the long text is cut to fit, and the rest of the log and the header's other fields are kept
