# Box breathing

**Status:** native app only (Grabber Native). Source: Igor's "Box Breathing App — Prototype Brief"
(2026-10-04); the brief suggested a web page first, Igor asked for it in the native app instead.
**Stories:** [160–165](../../stories/09-breathing.md).

## Summary

A guided box-breathing session: breathe in, hold, breathe out, hold, each for the same number of seconds, for a
few minutes. You choose how long a breath is and roughly how long to sit; the app shows a circle that fills and
empties with you and, if you want, tells you each step by voice or by tone so you can close your eyes.

## Goals

- From the home screen to breathing in two taps, with last time's choices already set.
- The picture alone is enough to follow; the sound alone is enough to follow.
- Timing that can be trusted: a ten-minute session ends within half a second of ten minutes.

## Non-goals

- No history, streaks, reminders or HealthKit mindful minutes. (The mirror already reads meditation from Health;
  writing to it is a separate decision.)
- No other patterns (4-7-8, unequal sides). Every side of the box is the same length.
- No widget or Shortcut. (The lock screen and the Dynamic Island do show the session:
  [Native Live Activity](2026-10-04-native-live-activity-design.md).)

## What you see

### Setup

- **Breath length**: presets, one tap each — **8 s, 10 s, 12 s, 15 s** — and **Custom** (Igor, 2026-10-05,
  #155: *"presets on 8 10 12 and 15 … and also add custom and set the in and out independently"*). A preset is
  four even sides of that length. Custom shows two sliders, **In** and **Out**, 3 to 15 seconds each: the inhale
  and its hold last *In*, the exhale and its hold last *Out*, so it is still a box, with a long side and a short
  side. The choice and Custom's two lengths are remembered. A phone that had a breath length from the old slider
  keeps it: one of the presets lights if it matches, and anything else opens as Custom with In and Out both at
  that length.
- **4·4·6·2** (Igor, 2026-10-11, #289: *"Breathing pattern 4,4,6,2"*): a pattern beside the presets, one tap like
  them: breathe in 4 seconds, hold 4, breathe out 6, hold 2 — four sides of their own lengths, 16 seconds a cycle.
  The line under the title reads *In 4, hold 4, out 6, hold 2.*; the cues, the hold bar and the timing follow each
  side's own length, and the choice is remembered like a preset. The finished session is named *Breathing ·
  4·4·6·2 · N cycles*. How the circle draws an uneven pattern (Igor: *"make it a trapezoid"*) is open, proposed on
  #289 and not part of this change: the ring draws it as it draws every breath.
- **Session length**: a slider from 2 to 15 minutes, in whole minutes, starting at 5.
- A summary line under them that changes as either slider moves: **"9 cycles · ends at 4 min 48 s"**. A session
  is always a whole number of cycles — the number closest to the session length chosen, never fewer than one —
  so it ends at the end of a hold, not mid-breath.
- **Cue**: Voice, Tone or Off. Choosing Voice or Tone plays a sample of it at once ("Breathe in", or the rising
  tone).
- **Begin**.
- All three choices are remembered for next time.

### Session

A near-black screen with one dark circle in the middle and a white ring that draws around its edge.

| Step | The ring | The circle | Tone |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inhale | draws from the bottom up both sides and closes at the top | grows from 90% to full size | rising |
| Hold | stays closed; a bar under the word fills left to right | full size | soft tick |
| Exhale | un-draws from the top back down to the bottom | shrinks to 90% | falling |
| Hold | gone; the bar fills left to right | 90% | soft tick |

- The step's word — **Inhale**, **Hold**, **Exhale**, **Hold** — is in the circle. Under the circle, small and
  dim: **"4:31 left"**.
- The circle's size eases in and out, as a breath does. The ring and the bar move at a constant rate, so they
  read as time.
- With **Voice**, a calm woman's voice with an Australian accent says "Let's begin", then "Breathe in", "Hold",
  "Breathe out", "Hold" as each step starts (the second hold is said a little lower and slower, so the two are
  told apart by ear), and "Well done" at the end. The first inhale waits two seconds for "Let's begin"; the
  circle reads **Ready** while it does.
- With **Tone**, each step starts with its tone and the session ends with a closing tone. With **Off**, silence.
- Music or a podcast already playing keeps playing; the cues sound over it.
- The screen stays on for the whole session and goes back to the phone's own setting afterwards.
- **Locking the phone or leaving the app does not pause.** The session keeps time and its cues keep sounding with
  the phone locked or another app in front, and the lock screen and the Dynamic Island show the step, the cycle
  and a countdown (story 166). Coming back finds the circle exactly where the session is (story 169).
- **Pause lives in the circle.** Tapping the circle pauses; tapping it again resumes. There is no separate pause
  button. While running, a small, faint pause mark sits low in the circle, so it reads as something to tap without
  competing with the word. While paused, the circle says so plainly: a play mark, **"Paused"** in place of the
  step's word, and **"tap to resume"** under it; the ring dims but stays where it stopped.
- Pausing freezes the ring, the circle, the bar and the time left exactly where they are. Resume continues from
  that point in the step: nothing jumps and the step is not announced again.
- For VoiceOver the circle is one button, labelled **Pause** while running and **Resume** while paused, with the
  step's word as its value.
- Only a tap on the circle pauses. A paused session stays paused with the phone locked; a running one runs on.
- **Back** (top left) leaves at once for Setup, with no confirmation.

### Done

**"Done"**, the session as it was — **"4 min 48 s · 9 cycles"** — and **Back to start**, which returns to Setup.
The closing tone (or "Well done") plays as this appears.

### In Health

Igor, 2026-10-05 ([#156](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/156)): *"we should log these as
meditations on the phone."*

- A session that reaches Done is saved to Health as a **Mindful Session** of its whole length, ending when Done
  appears. Health's Mindfulness, and the mirror's Meditation card, count it like any other meditation.
- A session left early with **Back** is saved as the part actually breathed, if that was **at least a minute**;
  under a minute is not saved. Paused time is not breathing: the entry ends when the session ended and is as long
  as the breathing was.
- iOS asks once whether Grabber Native may write Mindful Minutes, the next time **Today** opens, in the same sheet
  that asks to read Health. (Asking as a session ends was tried first: on the simulator Health's sheet can take
  most of a minute to appear, and over the breathing screen the request had not come back when the test gave up,
  so Today, where Igor already answers Health's questions, asks instead.) Until that is answered, or if Igor says no or later turns it off in
  Health, sessions are simply not saved; breathing works the same and the session log says why.
- The lead-in before the first inhale does not count.



Calm and quiet, monochrome on near-black; nothing bright, nothing that counts a score.

- **Type**: the words that carry the moment — the title, the step's word in the circle, the slider values,
  "Done" — are set in a light serif, so the screen reads like a quiet page rather than a dashboard. Labels are
  small, spaced-out capitals; numbers that change keep their width so nothing jitters.
- **Setup**: each slider shows its value large beside its label, with a faint dot for every whole step it can
  stop on and the ends of its range under it. The summary sits on its own line between hairlines. The cue is three
  quiet choices, each with a small symbol; the chosen one is lit. Begin is a full-width white pill at the bottom.
- **Session**: the circle has a little depth — slightly lighter at its centre than its edge — and the ring glows
  softly, more as it closes. Time left sits small and dim under the circle.
- **Done**: the closed ring, small and still, over "Done", the session's length and cycles, and a quiet
  outlined "Back to start".

## Ring styles

Igor, 2026-10-05 (#147): *"make the thing a little bit thicker? Think about how to keep it calm but a little more
interesting. Give me a setting cog that lets me pick between a bunch."*

A small cog at the top right of the setup screen opens **Ring style**: four choices, each with a still preview,
the chosen one lit. The choice is remembered across launches. Every style keeps the rules above — it fills as you
breathe in, stays full through the hold, empties as you breathe out, stays empty through the second hold, moves at
a constant rate, dims and freezes when paused, and is monochrome on near-black.

- **Line** (the default) — the ring as above, twice as thick as before.
- **Glow** — a thick, soft ring whose leading tips carry a small bright light, the arc fading toward where it began.
- **Beads** — twenty-four beads around the circle, lighting one pair at a time from the bottom up both sides; the
  unlit ones stay faintly visible, so the whole path is always there.
- **Tide** — no ring: the circle itself fills with soft light from the bottom like water rising as you breathe in,
  stays full through the hold, and drains as you breathe out. Its surface is level and still.

The Done screen draws its closed ring in the chosen style.

## Accessibility

- **Reduce Motion**: the ring and bar still move; the circle stays one size. Every ring style is still a fill that
  reads as time, so Reduce Motion changes none of them.
- **VoiceOver**: each step is announced as it starts, whatever the cue choice.

## The voice

The six phrases are sound files that ship in the app, so the voice works with no network. They are rendered
ahead of time by an ElevenLabs voice: a calm, gently spoken Australian woman, slow and unhurried, the best of a
few takes of each phrase. Rendered without an ElevenLabs key, the Mac's Australian voice (Karen) stands in. If a
file is ever missing, the phone's own Australian voice says the phrase instead. The longest phrase, "Let's
begin", fits inside the two-second lead-in.

## Edge cases

- The longest breath with the shortest session (15 s, 2 min) is two cycles; no setting gives less than one.
- The longest session (15 min) is 45 cycles at 5 s and 15 cycles at 15 s.
- A cue that is noticed late (the phone was busy) is played once, for the step the session is in now; steps
  that passed unheard are not replayed.
- Pause during the two-second lead-in holds the lead-in.

## Acceptance

- At 8 s and 5 min the summary reads "9 cycles · ends at 4 min 48 s"; moving either slider changes it. At 8 s and
  15 min it reads "28 cycles · ends at 14 min 56 s".
- Each of the four steps lasts the breath length, in the order above, with the ring, circle, bar and word as in
  the table.
- A 10-minute session at 5 s (30 cycles) reaches Done within 0.5 s of 10:00, and no step starts more than
  0.1 s late.
- Tap the circle mid-inhale: it reads "Paused · tap to resume" and nothing moves; a minute later tap it again:
  the ring continues from where it stopped, the inhale is not announced again, and the session's own length is
  unchanged. There is no pause button anywhere else on the screen.
- With Voice, each phrase is heard at the start of its step, in aeroplane mode, and over playing music.
- The cue choice and both sliders are as left after quitting and reopening the app.
- Finish a 2-minute session: Health shows a 2-minute Mindful Session ending when Done appeared. Leave a session
  with Back after 90 seconds of breathing: Health shows 1 min 30 s; leave after 40 seconds: nothing is saved.
- Every start, step, cue, pause, resume, finish and exit is in the session log, with how late each step was
  noticed.
