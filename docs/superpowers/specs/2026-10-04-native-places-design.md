# Native Places: the trail, the stays, the map — Design Spec

**Status:** Drafted 2026-10-04 (Igor: "how about location?" — Places is the next journey to move)
**Owner:** Igor
**Tracking:** bead `context-grabber-3ss` (the native port, step 5); stories [040–057](../../stories/03-places.md)
**Part of:** [Swift-native app](2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md). The rules the stays follow are unchanged
from [location clustering v2](2026-03-26-location-clustering-v2.md), the day accounting and naming from
[places breakdown](2026-04-11-places-breakdown-gaps-and-naming-design.md), the map from
[map controls](2026-05-31-map-controls-design.md) and [real route](2026-05-31-map-real-route-design.md).

## Summary

Grabber Native gets a **Places** screen that does what the Places tab and the Location sheet do in Context
Grabber: an opt-in trail recorded in the background, read back as stays at named places, a 24-hour strip and
bars per day that add up, a real map with the places and today's path, and the database export. The rules that
turn breadcrumbs into stays are the same, so the same trail gives the same stays, place names and hours in both
apps.

Until the cutover each app keeps its own trail. The native app therefore starts empty, and can **import** a
database exported from Context Grabber to bring the history and the known places across.

## Goals

- Every Places story that Context Grabber implements (040–053) holds in the native app.
- For the same trail and known places, the native app's stays, place names and per-day hours equal the current
  app's — checked against the real 36 000-point fixture, not only invented cases.
- History and known places come across from Context Grabber in one step, and doing it twice changes nothing.
- A problem with tracking can be answered from the session log: whether permission was given, whether tracking
  was on, when points arrived, what was pruned, what an import or export did.

## Non-goals

- Today's path on the home screen (story 054): a widget, so it waits for the widgets step.
- The Today tab's small map and Grab Context's location sections: the mirror and the export (step 4).
- Changing the clustering rules. Requests that come up become stories and wait.
- Syncing the two apps' trails. Import is a one-way copy, on demand.

## What Igor sees

### Home

The home screen lists **Places** under "Ported so far". It opens full screen; *Done* returns home.

### The Places screen, top to bottom

1. **The map** (stories 048–051, 057): Apple Maps streets, a pin per known place: its icon (below) ringed in the
   place's colour, with a small name chip under it; **You** as a cyan diamond with a halo; today's recorded path as a line. It is framed to include
   every pin and the path, and free to pan and zoom. Three small controls sit in its corners: **locate** (centre
   on You at neighbourhood zoom), **copy** (puts "lat, lng" to six decimals on the clipboard
   and shows "✓ Copied" briefly), **expand** (the same map full screen, with the same controls; collapse or a
   swipe down returns). Locate and copy are always there (story 058; Igor, 2026-10-17, from the old app's PR #57,
   where they vanished): with no fix yet they are dimmed, and a tap asks for one and briefly says *Waiting for a GPS
   fix…* on the map, even with a place selected, copying nothing and leaving the map where it is. The full-screen
   map also shows the places that have no name yet (below).
   **Today or the last 7 days** (Igor, 2026-10-10, #252: *"Location screen needs to be able to switch between
   today and last seven days"*): a small **Today · 7 days** switch in the map's free corner chooses which path is
   drawn, today's alone or the whole week the day cards cover, and the map reframes to hold it. The choice is
   remembered between visits and is the same embedded and full screen; it starts on Today. A long gap in the
   recording (a flight, the phone off) is one straight line, as it is for today. The day cards and the unnamed
   places do not change with it. Each switch is in the session log (`ui`, action map_range).
2. **The last seven days**, newest first (stories 043, 044, 046, 047). Each day is a card: the date and the
   elapsed hours (24h for a past day, hours so far for today); a strip of the day in time order — stays in their
   place's colour, transit faded, no data grey, the rest of today dimmest; then a bar per place (longest first,
   at most ten), a *—transit—* row and a *—no data—* row, which together add up to the header within a minute.
   A tap on the card shows each visit with its times. A day with neither a stay nor a point is left out.
   An unnamed place reads "Place N" in amber with a **＋** that names it (below).
3. **Known places** (story 045): each with its icon in its colour, coordinates and radius; swipe to delete; a
   tap opens the place, where its icon can be changed (story 057). **Add place**
   takes a name, a radius (100 m by default) and the position: *Use current* asks for a precise fix and refuses
   one older than thirty seconds with a line saying how old it was. **Import places** accepts the same JSON as
   today (an array, or an object with `knownPlaces` / `places`; `lat`/`latitude`, `lon`/`lng`/`longitude`,
   `radiusMeters`/`radius_meters`/`radius`).
4. **Tracking** (stories 040, 041): the Background Tracking switch, retention in days, the number of points
   stored and the permission as iOS reports it.
5. **History and export** (stories 052, 053, 055): *Copy daily summary* (one line per day: "Mon Apr 20: Home 9h,
   Office 8h, Gym 1h"), *Export database*, *Import from Context Grabber*.

### Naming a place (story 047)

The **＋** on a "Place N" row looks for known places within 500 m of that stay's centre. With none, a card asks
for a name and a radius (100 m) and shows the coordinates. With one or more, a card says how far the nearest is
and what growing it would do — "Place 3 is 168 m from Milstead & Co. Expanding would grow radius 50 m → 159 m and
shift the centre 57 m." — with **Expand**, **Create new** and **Cancel**, and "(+N more within 500 m)" when there
are others. Either way every stay at that place, on every day, is relabelled at once.

**Where it is** ([#160](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/160), Igor: *"When trying to add a
place need to see where it is"*). Both cards open with a small map at their top, centred on the stay: the stay's
centre as a pin, and on the name card the circle the new place will cover, which follows the radius as it is
typed. The merge card shows the nearest known place too, with its circle as it is now, so "168 m from Milstead &
Co." can be seen. The map is a picture of where, for looking, not for picking: dragging it does not move the
place.

### Unnamed places on the full-screen map (story 056)

The full-screen map shows, besides the named places, every place the stays found that has no name yet — each
"Place N" visited in the last seven days, the same period as the day cards. They are quiet: a grey dot, paler and
smaller than a named place's pin and never in a place colour, with a small chip saying how long Igor was there in
those seven days ("2.5h"). The dot grows with the time, from a small dot for a few minutes to about the size of a
named pin for a day or more, so the places that matter stand out. The full-screen framing includes them. The map
embedded on the screen stays as it was — named places, You and today's path — so the small map is not cluttered.

The dot sits at the place's centre: the average of its stays' centres, weighted by their points, as the clustering
weighs them.

Tapping a dot opens a card at the bottom of the map: the place's name ("Place 3"), the total time and the number
of visits in the last seven days, and each visit, newest first, with its day, its times and its length ("Mon Mar
23 · 9:10am–11:40am · 2.5h"; the five most recent, then "+N earlier"). The card's close button, or tapping
another dot, changes it; the copy control steps aside while it is open.

**Name this place** on the card is the same naming as the ＋ on a day card: with a known place within 500 m, the
card offering to grow it comes first; otherwise the name card, with the place's position filled in and a radius
that holds every visit — 100 m, the clustering's own radius, plus however far apart its visits' centres are,
rounded up to ten metres and never more than 250 m. In the real fixture the visits' centres are at most 9 m apart
and all but 2 of the unnamed stays' 2 340 points lie within 100 m of their place's centre (the farthest 111 m), so
this is 100 or 110 m and holds the place. Saving relabels every stay there at once: the grey dot becomes a named pin in its colour, and the day cards
follow.

### Place icons (story 057)

Every known place has an icon, a simple glyph in the system's symbol style, shown on its map pin and beside it in
the Known places list. Igor does not have to choose one: the app guesses it, in this order.

1. **From the name.** A whole word of the name gives the place away ("Mom's House", not "Householder"); the first
   rule that matches wins:

   | Words in the name | Icon |
   |---|---|
   | home, house, apartment, apt, condo | a house |
   | work, office, hq | a briefcase |
   | a word starting "kettlebel" or "kettlebil": kettlebell(s), Kettlebility, Kettlebillity | a kettlebell |
   | gym, fitness, crossfit, yoga, pilates, dojo | a dumbbell |
   | coffee, cafe, café, espresso, starbucks | a cup and saucer |
   | restaurant, diner, bistro, pizza, sushi, grill, kitchen, eatery | a fork and knife |
   | store, market, grocery, shop, supermarket, mall, costco, safeway, qfc | a shopping cart |
   | park, trail, garden, forest | a tree |
   | school, university, college, campus | a graduation cap |
   | hospital, clinic, doctor, dentist, medical | a medical case |
   | airport | an airplane |
   | beach | a beach umbrella |
   | church, temple, synagogue, mosque, chapel, cathedral, museum | a building with columns (there is no church glyph) |
   | library | a book |
   | bar, pub, brewery, tavern, winery | a wine glass |
   | hotel, motel, inn, airbnb | a bed |
   | pool, swim, aquatic | a swimmer |
   | parking, garage | a car |

   The kettlebell is the one rule that matches the start of a word, not the whole word, because Igor's gym is
   Kettlebility (spelled Kettlebillity on his phone) and no whole word says "gym" there
   ([#260](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/260)). The system has no kettlebell glyph, so the app
   draws one: the same kettlebell as the daily strip's gym.

2. **From Apple Maps**, when the name says nothing ("Milstead & Co"). Two questions, in order:
   - **The business the place is named after.** Apple Maps is searched for the place's name around it; a point of
     interest with the same name (punctuation and case aside: "Milstead & Co." is "Milstead & Co"), or one whose
     name holds it, within 500 m of the place's centre, gives its category's icon. A name is strong evidence and a
     known place's centre can be off: Apple Maps puts Milstead & Co. 251 m from the fixture's place.
   - **What is there.** Otherwise the points of interest within the place's radius (at least 50 m) of its centre:
     the nearest one decides, and only if its category has an icon. When the nearest has none — often the place
     itself, uncategorised — nothing is guessed, because the shop next door is not the place. (Checked on the
     simulator against the fixture's places: taking the nearest *iconed* one called Kettlebility a food market,
     23 m away, and Milstead & Co a restaurant, 8 m away; by name they are a fitness centre and a café. On Igor's phone, 2026-10-10, the gym was spelled
     Kettlebillity, the search by name found nothing, and the nearest was a restaurant 8 m away, so the gym showed a
     fork and knife (#260): the reason for the kettlebell rule.)

   The categories with icons: a fitness centre or climbing gym a dumbbell, a café or bakery a cup, a restaurant a
   fork and knife, a food market or store a cart, a park, campground or hike a tree, a school or university a
   graduation cap, a hospital or pharmacy a medical case, an airport an airplane, a beach an umbrella, a library a
   book, a museum the columns, a brewery, winery, distillery or nightlife a wine glass, a hotel a bed, a swimming
   spot a swimmer, parking or a petrol or charging station a car. The answer is remembered, so Apple Maps is asked
   once per place, and again only after the place is grown. Without a network, or when Apple Maps fails, the place
   shows a plain pin for now and is asked again next time; nothing on screen complains.
3. **A plain pin** otherwise — also remembered, so a place Apple Maps knows nothing about is not asked again.

**Choosing one.** A tap on a known place opens it: its name, position and radius, its icon with where it came from
("Guessed from the name", "From Apple Maps: Fitness center", "No guess: a plain pin", "Chosen"), and a grid of
twenty-one icons — house, briefcase, dumbbell, kettlebell, cup, fork and knife, cart, tree, graduation cap, medical case,
airplane, beach umbrella, columns, book, wine glass, bed, swimmer, two people, car, heart, pin. A tap on one makes
it the place's icon at once, on the map and in the list; it is remembered and never guessed over, even if the
place is renamed or grown. *Use the guess* gives the choice back to the guess.

The icons are kept beside the known places, which stay exactly as Context Grabber shares them; Context Grabber
ignores them, and a place imported from it is guessed like any other.

### Background tracking (story 040)

Off on a fresh install. Switching it on asks for location While Using, then Always. With Always granted the app
records points while it is in the background and after it has been closed, and the switch stays on across
launches. Without Always — denied, or only While Using — the switch goes back off and a line under it says what
iOS allowed and that Settings is where to change it; nothing is recorded. Switching it off stops recording at
once; the points already stored stay.

While tracking is on iOS shows the blue location indicator when the app is in the background, as Context Grabber
does: a trail being recorded is never invisible.

### Retention (story 041)

Thirty days by default, from 1 to 365. Points older than the retention are deleted when the app comes to the
front and immediately when the number is lowered; the breakdown and the point count follow.

### The precise fix (story 042)

Each time the app comes to the front it asks for one precise fix; the map's You moves to it when it arrives. The
fix is only for You and for *Use current*; it is not added to the trail.

### Export (story 052)

*Export database* offers the app's whole database file in the share sheet — locations, known places, settings,
and whatever other journeys have stored — named `context-grabber.db`, the same name and format Context Grabber
exports. The button says what it is doing while it prepares the file. The copy is a consistent snapshot even if a
point arrives while it is made.

### Import from Context Grabber (story 055)

The way in is the file Context Grabber's *Export Database* produces. Igor can either

- share it from Context Grabber (or from Files) and choose Grabber Native, or
- tap *Import from Context Grabber* and pick the file in Files.

The app copies in that file's locations and known places and says what it did: "Imported 36 601 points (0
already here) and 4 places (0 already here)." Doing it again adds nothing — a point already present (same time,
same coordinates) is skipped, and so is a known place whose name is already taken here (the native one is kept:
it may have been grown since). Settings, the tracking switch and other journeys' data are not imported. A file
that is not a Context Grabber database is refused with a line saying why, and nothing changes. Imported points
older than the retention are pruned like any others, so an old export brings back only what retention allows.

## Differences from Context Grabber while both live side by side

- **Two trails.** Each app records its own; with both switched on the phone records twice (the battery risk in
  the parent spec). Import is the bridge until the cutover, when the native app opens Context Grabber's database
  in place and there is one trail again.
- **Tracking survives the app being closed.** Context Grabber's trail stops when iOS terminates the app and
  resumes only when Igor opens it. The native app also asks iOS to wake it on a significant move, and resumes
  the trail from there.
- **Day boundaries follow the calendar.** On the two days a year the clocks change, a day is 23 or 25 hours long
  and its strip and header say so; Context Grabber cuts every day at exactly 24 hours, so on those days its
  breakdown is off by an hour.
- **One screen.** The Places tab and the Location sheet are one screen; the three "copy" actions become the map's
  copy control and *Copy daily summary*. *Copy Location Details* (the export's location section as JSON) waits for
  Grab Context in step 4.
- **Errors** are on screen in plain words and in the session log with the state around them; a shake attaches
  the log.

## Rationale: how the trail is recorded

| Option | What it gives | Why not alone |
|---|---|---|
| Standard updates, ~100 m accuracy, no distance filter, never auto-paused (what Context Grabber does) | a dense trail while moving: the stays' hundred-metre radius and the transit / no-data split (a run of points less than ten minutes apart) are tuned on exactly this | stops for good when iOS terminates the app |
| Significant-change monitoring | wakes a terminated app after a move of roughly 500 m; cheap | one point per few minutes and hundreds of metres: too coarse to make stays or a route on its own |
| Visits | arrival and departure at a place, cheap | delivered minutes to hours late, as summaries, not points; the stays are already derived from points |
| Fine accuracy with a distance filter | a crisper route | more battery for nothing the stays need; a different input than the rules were tuned on |

**Chosen:** standard updates exactly as Context Grabber records them — so the same rules see the same kind of
trail — plus significant-change monitoring, so that a terminated app is woken and the standard updates resume.
Visits are not used.

**When the phone sits still, iOS sends nothing** (motion coprocessor), so a night at home is a few points in the
evening and a few in the morning. This is expected, and the clustering already joins consecutive stays at the
same place across such a gap (story 044). More frequent collection would not help and is not attempted.

## Acceptance criteria

- With tracking off on a fresh install, no points are stored and no location permission is asked for until the
  switch is touched.
- Switching tracking on and allowing Always records points with the app in the background; denying leaves the
  switch off with a line under it; the switch's state survives a relaunch.
- Lowering retention from 30 to 7 deletes the older points at once; the point count and the breakdown follow.
- For the fixture trail and its four known places, the native stays (place, start, end, points) equal Context
  Grabber's, and so do the seven-day breakdowns.
- Every day card's place, transit and no-data rows add up to its header within a minute.
- Naming "Place N" relabels every stay at that place; expanding a known place shows the new radius and centre
  shift before it is applied.
- Importing the fixture export brings in all its points and its four places; importing it again adds none.
- A file that is not a Context Grabber database is refused and nothing changes.
- The exported file opens as SQLite on the Mac with the same tables Context Grabber's export has for locations,
  known places and settings.
- The map's **Today · 7 days** switch draws today's path or the week's, reframes the map to it, and is remembered
  after leaving Places and after a relaunch (#252).
- The map shows the known places in the same colours as their bars, You, and today's path; locate, copy and
  expand work as described.
- Every known place shows an icon on the map and in the list: from its name when a word gives it away, else from
  the Apple Maps business of that name within 500 m, else from the nearest Apple Maps point of interest within its
  radius when that one has an icon, else a plain pin; without a network nothing fails
  and the guess is tried again later. A chosen icon replaces the guess at once and stays.
- The full-screen map shows a grey dot for every unnamed place of the last seven days, sized and labelled by its
  hours; a tap shows its visits and *Name this place*, which offers to grow a known place within 500 m or names it
  at its centre with the suggested radius; after naming, it is a named pin.
- Each of these leaves its event in the session log: permission, tracking on and off, points arriving (sampled),
  pruning, import, export, opening the screen, tapping an unnamed place and naming it from the map, each place's icon with where it came
  from (name, Apple Maps, default, chosen) and each Apple Maps lookup.
