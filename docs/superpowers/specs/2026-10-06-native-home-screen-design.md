# Native Home Screen: the launchers, and a cog for the rest — Design Spec

Issue [#166](https://github.com/idvorkin/context-grabber/issues/166). Igor, 2026-10-06: *"Add a settings cog on
the front page. There's just a lot of stuff here that I don't use."* Story
[147](../../stories/08-reporting-problems.md#user-story-147). Part of the
[Swift-native app](2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md).

## Summary

The native app's home screen was a diagnostics list with the journeys on top: below the launchers sat the gist
token, the build, this launch's log and *Report a problem* — things Igor reads once a week, if that. The home
screen now holds only the launchers. A cog in the bottom right corner opens a **Home screen** sheet where each launcher can
be hidden or moved, and where the diagnostics now live.

## Goals

- The home screen is a list of things to open, nothing else.
- Igor chooses which launchers show and in what order, and the choice outlasts a relaunch and an update.
- A launcher added in a later build appears on its own, without Igor doing anything and without his earlier
  choices being lost.
- The build, the log and *Report a problem* are one tap away, not gone. (The gist token went with the gist,
  2026-10-11: a troubled call files an automatic report instead.)

## Non-goals

- Settings for the journeys themselves (the timer's voice, the call's backend): those stay on their own screens.
- Renaming launchers, icons, or grouping them into folders.
- Hiding a journey from anything but the home screen: links, Shortcuts, the widget and the launch hooks still
  open a hidden journey.

## What Igor sees

**The home screen.** No title (Igor, 2026-10-06: *"Get rid of grabber native title"* — the phone already says
which app this is, and the space goes to the rows), no bar across the top at all (*"Why dead space at the top of my screen"*), a
cog button in the bottom right corner (*"cog in bottom corner if anywhere"*), and the launchers as large rows
in Igor's order: Call Larry, Today, Gym Timer, Box breathing, Places, Think of a card, Cockpit until he changes
it. No header or footer around them: the old *Ported so far* / *Everything else is still in Context Grabber*
lines are gone, since every row is ported by definition. Anything that sits above the launchers in a later build
(a strip, a summary) stays above them. When every launcher is hidden, the home screen says so in one quiet line
and points at the cog.

**Not just a list** (Igor, 2026-10-07, #189: *"rework the home screen so it's not just a list"*; he chose the
*Today first* layout). Under the usage strip and What's new:

- **The Today card.** The mirror on the home screen: last night's sleep, today's steps, HRV and exercise
  minutes, each a big number with its name, and when they were read (*as of 7:10*). It shows the last grab the app
  made, so opening the app never asks Health for anything; tapping the card opens Today, which grabs fresh. Before
  any grab the card says *Today — tap to look* and opens Today the same way. A number Health did not give is a dash,
  never 0.
- **The first four launchers as tiles**, two by two, big enough to hit without looking: the first four of Igor's
  order (Today itself is skipped, since the card is Today). Each tile is the launcher's icon beside its name, one
  line tall, so the tiles take little height (Igor, 2026-10-08, #225: *"a little bit thinner so I have more
  available vertical space"*); Call Larry's tile still shows a live call's state under its name.
- **The rest as tiles too**, under the four, in the same order (Igor, iPad, 2026-10-10, #235: *"if I have two
  things on a row, they should look like the two things at the top of the boxes so they're consistent"*). One
  look for every launcher: a launcher alone on its line is one tile the width of two; a pair is two tiles side by
  side, exactly like the four. No grouped list under the tiles. Two pairs share one line, half
  each, when both are shown: **Exercise Analyzer** with **Workout Supermix**, and **Eulogy** with **Eulogy song**
  (#225). The pair sits where the first of the two comes in Igor's order, in that order; hiding one gives the other
  the whole line back. A pair member that is one of the four tiles stays a tile. In half a line the two long
  names are short: *Analyzer* and *Supermix*.
- **DRAFT, for Igor to confirm (2026-10-11, reports #284–#286): three to a row.** Every launcher under the Today
  card and the strip becomes a small tile, three to a line, with its icon above a one- or two-word name (*"put three
  under a row, use shorter words plus the icon"*): Call, Timer, Breathe, Places, Card, Analyzer, Supermix, Cockpit,
  Eulogy, Song, Recent, Random. Pairs and the width-of-two tile go away, since every tile is the same size, and
  Recent and Random sit side by side in Igor's order (#285). **Settings becomes a tile too**, the last one (#286:
  *"settings can be a button now"*), and the floating cog goes. A hidden launcher closes the gap. Call Larry's tile
  still shows a live call under its name.
- **How a launcher looks** (Igor, 2026-10-08: *"Doesn't it look bad? … think about making it good via
  design"*): each launcher has its own colour, and only its icon carries it, as a white glyph on a small rounded
  square, the way Settings draws its rows. The names are in the ordinary text colour, one size for every row so
  nothing shrinks to fit. The same icons are on the Today card and in the cog's list of launchers.

**The daily strip** (Igor, iPad, 2026-10-10, #236: *"a little strip for things I want to do every day, like gym,
and that can get a checkmark … an up/down counter somehow that's still small. I want this all in one strip"*;
#238: *"days since gym"*). One thin card, one line tall, between the Today card and the tiles: the few things Igor
means to do every day, each a glance and a tap.

- **Gym** — a check. Grey with *3d* beside it when the last gym day was three days ago; green ✓ once today counts.
  Today counts when Igor taps it, when the Gym Timer finishes a workout, or when Health has a strength workout
  today. Days since gym counts from the last day that counted, by any of the three; *never* before the first.
- **Meditation** (Igor, 2026-10-10, #257: *"need a meditation in my thing too"*) — a check that, like Gym, turns
  green on its own: when a Box breathing session reached Done today, or when Health had mindful minutes today at
  the last grab (any meditation app; the app's own breathing writes them too). A tap is the fallback, and a tap
  can be taken back; a check from breathing or Health stays. A session in another app shows once Today has grabbed,
  because opening the home screen asks Health nothing.
- **Journal** — a check: a tap marks today written; another tap takes it back.
- **DRAFT (#287): the strip's icons.** Balloons as a *balloon dog* and the journal as a *feather pen*. SF Symbols
  has neither (it has a dog, a balloon, and pens: `pencil.tip`, `signature`), so each would be a drawn symbol of our
  own in the same style, or the nearest system one.
- **Balloons** — a count of balloons made for others today: 🎈 and the number. A tap adds one; a long press takes
  one off (never below 0). A soft tick on each change.
- **Magic** — the same counter, for magic done for others: 🪄 and the number.

Every item starts the day fresh at local midnight; the days before are kept, so the week can be read later (by
Larry, in the export: a later change, not this one). A tapped gym check can be taken back the same way as the
journal's; a check that came from the timer or Health stays. Every change is in the session log (`ui`, action
daily_strip, with the item and its new value), and so is each item turning green by itself (`daily_strip_auto`,
with the item and where it came from). The strip can be hidden from the cog like a launcher.

Non-goals: choosing other items or adding new ones from the app, streaks, reminders, history charts.

Order, hiding and Reset in the cog work as before: moving a launcher into the first four makes it a tile.

**The cog** opens the **Home screen** sheet, with *Done* at the top right. It has two parts:

1. **Launchers** — every launcher, shown or hidden, in the current order, each with its icon, its name and a
   switch. A switch off hides that row from the home screen at once; on brings it back in the same place.
   Rows are dragged by their handle to reorder; the home screen follows. A footer says hidden rows still open
   from links and Shortcuts. *Reset to default* puts every row back, in the default order.
2. **About and diagnostics** — what used to be the bottom of the home screen: *Build* (commit, branch, version), *This launch*
   (the log's name and when it started, and where to find logs in Files), and *Report a problem* with its
   reminder that a shake works on any screen.

**Shake to report** still works everywhere, including with the sheet up; the report names the screen as
*home_settings*.

## Remembering

- The order and the hidden set are remembered on the phone, with the app's other settings, and survive a
  relaunch and an update.
- A launcher the remembered order does not know (one added by a later build) is shown, at the end.
- A remembered launcher the build no longer has is ignored, and forgotten at the next change.
- If nothing can be remembered (the settings could not be opened), the home screen shows the default order and
  changes last until the app closes.

## Explaining itself

- Opening the sheet is logged (`ui`, action home_settings).
- Every change — a switch, a move, a reset — is logged with the full order and the hidden list as they now
  are (`ui`, action home_rows), so a log says what the home screen looked like.

## Acceptance criteria

- The home screen shows only the launchers (and anything placed above them), with a cog in the bottom right corner and nothing above the first card but the status bar.
- Hiding a row through the cog removes it from the home screen; after a relaunch it is still hidden.
- Moving a row through the cog moves it on the home screen; after a relaunch the order holds.
- Reset brings back every row in the default order.
- A launcher unknown to the remembered order shows at the end; a forgotten one does not break anything.
- The build, the log and *Report a problem* are reachable from the sheet, and a shake with the
  sheet up files a report.
- A hidden journey still opens from its link, Shortcut or launch hook.
- Every launcher under the Today card is a tile of the same look: the four two by two, a lone launcher one wide
  tile, a pair two tiles side by side the width of the four's (#235).

- The daily strip shows Gym, Meditation, Journal, Balloons and Magic in one line under the Today card. A tap checks Gym or
  Journal (a second tap unchecks). A tap adds a balloon or a trick, a long press takes one off, never below 0.
  Gym shows days since the last gym day until today counts, and a finished Gym Timer workout counts today with
  no tap. After midnight everything starts fresh and yesterday's values are kept (#236, #238).
- After a Box breathing session reaches Done, or a grab that finds mindful minutes today, Meditation is green
  with no tap, and the log has `daily_strip_auto` naming where it came from (#257).
