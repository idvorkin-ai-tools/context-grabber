## Summary

The Cockpit — Igor's tailnet-only decision dashboard — opens inside Grabber Native the way it opens inside Context
Grabber: the page itself, not a re-implementation, with the phone's real microphones and outputs handed to its
pickers. The page needs no change: it finds the same bridge, speaks the same messages, and is told it is in the
app by the same tag on its address.

## What is the same as Context Grabber

Everything the four specs above promise, with the tab replaced by a screen:

- **The page, whole.** Every surface of the Cockpit, scrolling, typing, expanding rows, swiping back through its
  own history. Pull down at the top to reload.
- **Voice.** The page's microphone works. iOS asks once for Grabber Native's microphone (it is a separate app until
  the cutover, so it asks even though Context Grabber already has it). The microphone is granted to the Cockpit
  itself without a second prompt; any other site asking inside the screen gets iOS's prompt. Audio plays inline and
  starts without an extra tap.
- **Real microphones and outputs.** The page's pickers list every microphone iOS can see, by name, and Automatic,
  Speaker and any connected headset as outputs; a choice takes effect mid-call; what is really carrying audio is
  reported; AirPods arriving or leaving update the pickers without a reload; a choice the phone undoes underneath
  (the page's own capture starting is the usual cause) is put back. Every request the page makes gets exactly one
  answer. Wire protocol unchanged: [cockpit-audio-bridge.md](../../cockpit-audio-bridge.md).
- **The page knows it is in the app.** Its address carries `client=context-grabber` and the build. The native app
  says *context-grabber* too: it becomes Context Grabber at the cutover, and the build already tells the two apart
  (a native build is a commit of the native app). The pickers keep their per-app memory for the same reason: the
  page stores the app's picks apart from the laptop browser's, and both apps are "the app".
- **Links that leave the Cockpit** open in the phone's browser; the Cockpit stays where it was.
- **Can't connect** — Tailscale off, no network, the serving machine asleep, or a server error: a panel saying
  *Can't reach the Cockpit*, the hint to check Tailscale and the machine, the address tried, **Try again**, and the
  error itself with a **Copy error** button that carries the error, the address and the build. Never a blank page.
  A web page that crashes in the background is reloaded rather than left empty.
- **The panel belongs to the page that failed, not to the screen.** The screen is always in exactly one of three
  states: *loading* (a spinner over the page), *showing a page*, or *failed* (the panel). Every navigation that
  starts — Back, Cockpit, Try again, pull to refresh, a link, the page's own reload — goes to *loading*, which takes
  the panel down; a page that then finishes shows, and one that fails, or answers with an HTTP error, brings the
  panel back with that page's address and reason. So after a failed page, Back or Cockpit loading fine shows the page,
  never the old panel over it. A navigation cancelled by another (a second tap, a reload mid-load) is not a failure.
  Back shows whenever the web view has a page to go back to, and Cockpit whenever the page in front is not the
  dashboard's start page; both stay in the footer under the panel, so a failed page can always be left.
- **The screen stays awake while a call is live in the page** — from the page saying the call is starting until it
  says it ended, or the page goes away (reload, failure, a crash). With no call, the Cockpit locks on the phone's
  normal schedule. A function of the call, not of the screen being open.

## What differs

- **A screen, not a tab.** The native app has a home screen while journeys move over; *Cockpit* is a row on it.
  It opens full screen. There is still no header: a slim footer carries **Done**, which returns home — the native
  app's equivalent of "just the footer is fine".
- **Back inside the Cockpit** (Igor, iPad, 2026-10-10, #234: *"When I am in the cockpit and I open the Lavish, or
  I open a blog, or I open something else, I can't go back … At the weakest I need a back button."*). A page the
  dashboard opens on its own machine (Lavish, a blog proposal, another tool) opens in place, so the footer has a
  **Back** button, shown whenever there is a page to go back to; it goes back one page, as Safari's does. Beside
  it, **Cockpit** takes the dashboard back to its start page in one tap. *Done* no longer wears a back arrow, since
  it is not back: it leaves the Cockpit. Each page the Cockpit lands on, and each Back or Cockpit tap, goes into the
  session log with its address. Tabs are not part of this: Back covers the case.
- **Leaving keeps the page.** *Done* hides the Cockpit; it does not close it. Opening it again in the same launch
  shows the dashboard exactly as it was — scroll, expanded rows, a recording in progress — with no reload, as
  switching tabs did. A new launch loads it fresh.
- **The page's call button stays in the app.** Inside the app the page's ☎ hands the call to the app: the Cockpit
  steps back and Grabber Native's own Call screen comes up with a call starting, on the backend the page asked for
  (the remembered one when it asked for none). Context Grabber does not open. A ☎ while a call is already up
  brings that call forward rather than starting another, and the page's hand-off arriving twice (its message and
  its fallback link) starts one call, not two. Any other Grabber link the page opens is followed inside the app
  the same way.
- **The audio session.** Opening the Cockpit readies the phone's audio for recording, as the tab's first visit did.
  If the Gym Timer has since set the audio its own way, the next opening readies it again; otherwise opening the
  Cockpit leaves the audio alone.
- **Everything it does is in the session log** — each load and how long it took or why it failed, each bridge
  message both ways, the roster and route each time it is sent — so a shake from the Cockpit attaches the evidence.

## The usage strip on the home screen

The first piece of the Cockpit that lives in the app itself rather than in the page (Igor, 2026-10-05: *"better
inline cockpit features by exposing cockpit APIs? I'd love to see the remaining usage as a strip"*). The Cockpit
already tracks how much of Claude's weekly allowance and of the ElevenLabs voice budget is used; the strip shows
what is **left**, at a glance, without opening the dashboard.

- **Where:** the top of Grabber Native's home screen, above the rows, as a thin card (Igor, 2026-10-06: *"make
  tokens a card thinner"*): hairline bars and small type, about two lines tall, so the launchers stay the
  biggest thing on the screen.
- **What it says:** three bars, each a fill of what remains with its number beside it —
  - **Week** — the weekly Claude allowance left, in percent;
  - **the current model** (Fable today; named as the Cockpit names it) — that model's allowance left, in percent;
  - **Voice** — the ElevenLabs budget left, in hours (or minutes under an hour).

  Under them, one line: when the weekly allowance resets (*resets in 14H*), the Cockpit's pacing verdict (*On
  track*), and when the voice budget resets.
- **Low is loud.** A bar with under 20% left is orange, under 10% red.
- **Unspent is loud too** (Igor, 2026-10-05: *"If I have quota, I'm going to lose"*). When the week resets in under
  24 hours and more than 20% of it is still left, the line under the bars leads with what is about to go to waste,
  in green: *31% to spend · resets in 13H · On track*. The allowance does not roll over, so this is a nudge to use
  it, not a warning.
- **Old is loud.** If the Cockpit says a reading is stale, that half of the strip says how old it is (*2h old*) in
  orange rather than looking current. A reading the Cockpit does not have is not drawn — never shown as 0%.
- **Fresh enough on its own.** It loads when the app opens or comes back to the front, and again every five minutes
  while the home screen is up.
- **Tap to refresh.** Tapping the strip asks the Cockpit for a new reading — the same ask as the Cockpit's own
  refresh button, so Larry takes it, which takes about a minute. The strip says *refreshing…* while the Cockpit
  says the ask is outstanding, checking every ten seconds, and shows the new reading when it lands; after five
  minutes it stops waiting and keeps the reading it had.
- **Off the tailnet it steps aside.** If the Cockpit cannot be reached the strip is not drawn at all — the home
  screen still works — and the failure is in the session log. A strip that had loaded keeps its last reading,
  marked with its age.
- **In the session log:** each load, what it showed or why it failed, and each tap to refresh.

Non-goals for the strip: a lock-screen version (the home-screen widget is [the live tile](2026-10-06-native-live-tile-design.md)), history or charts, any
change to the Cockpit's server.

Acceptance (strip):

8. On the tailnet, opening Grabber Native shows the strip above the rows with Week, the model and Voice left,
   matching the Cockpit's own usage panel.
9. A bar under 20% left is orange; under 10% red; a stale reading says its age.
10. Tapping the strip shows *refreshing…* until the Cockpit's new reading lands (about a minute), then shows it.
11. Off the tailnet the home screen has no strip and no error; back on, the next foreground shows it.
12. With 31% of the week left and the reset 13 hours away, the line reads *31% to spend · resets in 13H* with the
    first part green; with 2 days to the reset, or 15% left, it does not say *to spend*.

## Non-goals

- `grabber://cockpit` and the *Open Cockpit* Shortcut. They wait for the rest of step 7, when links open the native
  app.
- Any change to the Cockpit page or to the bridge protocol.
- A native picker, a native call inside the Cockpit, offline copies of the dashboard, stored credentials.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The home screen has a **Cockpit** row; it opens the dashboard full screen with a footer **Done** and no header.
2. Done, then Cockpit again in the same launch: same scroll position and expanded rows, no loading flash.
3. With AirPods connected, the page's microphone picker lists the iPhone microphone and the AirPods by name, and its
   output picker offers Automatic, Speaker and the AirPods; choosing Speaker mid-call moves the audio within a second.
4. The page's address carries `client=context-grabber&v=<the native build>`.
5. Off the tailnet: the *Can't reach the Cockpit* panel with the address, the error, Copy error and Try again; with
   Tailscale back, Try again loads the page without restarting the app.
5. A page that fails or answers 404, then Back (or Cockpit): the spinner, then the page before it, and no panel.
6. A live call in the page keeps the screen lit past the auto-lock interval; with no call the screen locks.
7. An off-Cockpit link opens Safari and leaves the dashboard in place.
8. Open a page the dashboard links to on its own machine: the footer shows **Back**; Back returns to the dashboard
   and the button goes; **Cockpit** returns to the start page from any depth; the log has `cockpit_page` for each
   page and `cockpit_back` / `cockpit_home` for each tap.
8. The session log of a launch that opened the Cockpit shows the load (ok and milliseconds, or the error), the
   bridge's `audio.ready`, each request and its answer, and the device roster.
9. On the simulator, a test page speaking the bridge receives a device list with at least one microphone, and its
   address carries the client tag.
