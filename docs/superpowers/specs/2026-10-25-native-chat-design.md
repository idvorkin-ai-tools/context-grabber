# Chat with Larry in Grabber Native — Design Spec

Igor, 2026-10-25: *"can we iterate on inbox feature so it's more like chat? … I want to be able to have chat threads
there and stop needing telegram if I don't want it."* On sharing: *"share to a new thread."* On hearing back: *"A and
B"* — the app refreshes while open and counts unread replies, and a background check notifies of Larry's replies.
This is the "later spec" the [Inbox spec](2026-10-17-native-share-inbox-design.md) left room for; it replaces the
Inbox's list. Part of the [Swift-native app](2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md).

## Summary

The Inbox becomes **Chat**: a list of conversations with Larry, each a thread of Igor's messages and Larry's replies.
A share from another app starts a new thread unless Igor picks a recent one on its card (#587). The threads are the Cockpit's chat threads — the same ones the
Cockpit's Chat tab shows and Larry already answers — so a conversation started on the phone can be picked up on the
laptop and back. Writing still works with no network, as the Inbox does today. While the app is open the thread
updates by itself; while it is not, the phone checks now and then and notifies Igor of a reply.

## Goals

- Talk to Larry in threads from the phone, without Telegram.
- A share starts its own thread, with the shared thing as its first message, or goes into a recent thread Igor picks
  on its card (#587).
- Nothing written is lost: a message waits on the phone until the Cockpit has it, and reaches it once.
- Igor can tell, without opening each thread, which ones Larry has answered.

## Non-goals

- Instant alerts like Telegram's. That needs real push and a paid developer account; a later spec (option C) if
  wanted. Telegram stays available for anything that must arrive at once.
- Larry starting a conversation that only Telegram carries. Threads Larry starts on the Cockpit do appear here.
- Searching, renaming or deleting threads from the phone. Archiving is the phone's way to close one (#589).
- A voice conversation inside a thread (the Call screen is that). Speaking a message is in (#448): it becomes text
  Igor reads before he sends.
- Sharing a file in from another app (#633). A file reaches a thread through the paperclip; the share card takes no files.

## What Igor sees

**The tile.** The home-screen *Inbox* tile becomes *Chat*, with the same raccoon-and-mailbox picture. Its number is
the conversations with a reply Igor has not read, plus any of his messages not yet sent.

**The list.** The pinned thread, then newest activity first. Each row: the thread's title, the last message's first
line and who wrote it, when, and an unread mark when Larry has replied since Igor last looked. Finished threads fold
under *Done*, by the same rule the Cockpit uses, so the phone and the laptop agree. The round **+** and the voice button stay at the lower right,
floating over the list, and the list runs to the bottom of the screen (Igor, 2026-11-05, #685: *"These buttons might as well
float ... to maximize my available space"*; this replaces the opaque bar of #637). A row passing under them shows through
around them, and the end of the list scrolls up clear of them, so no row is ever stuck beneath. A swipe can't start on a
button itself, only on the rest of the row. The **+** starts a new thread. Pull to refresh. With no network, the quiet offline line from the Inbox stays.

**Archiving** (Igor, 2026-11-01: "Let me archive threads both via swipe and via buttons in chat overflow"; #589, the
Cockpit's archive shipped first). Swiping a thread left in the list offers *Archive*; it folds under *Done* at once,
and the list shows *Archived "title"* with *Undo* for five seconds. An archived thread under *Done* swipes to
*Unarchive*. Inside a thread, the **⋯** menu at the top has *Archive chat*, or *Unarchive chat* when it is archived;
archiving from there goes back to the list. A new message from either side brings an archived thread back by itself,
as on the Cockpit. When the Cockpit refuses or can't be reached, the thread goes back where it was and a copyable
problem says why, in the list and on the open thread, until the next archive or a pull to refresh. Changes to one thread
happen in order: an *Undo* tapped before the Cockpit has answered the archive waits for that answer. A thread the
Cockpit still calls finished by its own rule stays under *Done* after *Unarchive*.

**The pinned thread** (Igor, 2026-11-02: "pinned thread on top"; #598). One always-on thread with Larry sits at the top of
the list with a pin, for dropping anything into, even before it has a message. It can't be archived, swiped away or
ticked in *Select*, its screen has no **⋯** menu, it never folds under *Done* and it never says *Looks done*. With only
the pinned thread live there is nothing to tick, so *Select* is off.

**A skill's thread** (#632; the Cockpit's half is cockpit#90). The Cockpit can pin a second kind of thread that a skill
answers instead of Larry; the first is *idvorkin*. It sits right under Larry's pinned thread, above everything else,
however recent the others are, and is there before its first message, reading *Ask idvorkin*. Everything the pinned
thread can't do, it can't do either: no archive, no ticking, no **⋯**, no *Done*, no *Looks done*. The bar says *Message
idvorkin* and a message there is not sent to Larry. The reply comes in by itself like any other, usually within half a
minute, with the skill's name and a lettered avatar above the bubble; Larry's own replies look as they always did. The
list row and the notification name the skill when it spoke last (*idvorkin: …*), not Larry. A refused message on this
thread reads *idvorkin refused it*.

When the skill can't answer, the Cockpit says why in the thread, and the app draws that as a copyable error under the
skill's name, not as a bubble. It is not an answer: a message of Igor's with only a failure after it does not show 🏆,
whatever the Cockpit's receipt says, and shows 👀 until a real reply follows. A notification or list row can't tell a
failure from a reply, since the list doesn't say, so it shows the failure's own words under the skill's name.

A Cockpit that doesn't have skill threads yet changes nothing: no second pinned thread, and Larry's threads read as
before.

**Archiving several, and threads that look done** (Igor, 2026-11-02; #599). *Select* at the top of the list turns the
live threads into checkboxes, and *Archive (N)* at the bottom, below the floating buttons and clear of them, archives them together, with *Undo* for five seconds for
all of them (*Archived 3 chats*). *Cancel* leaves the list as it was. Larry marks a thread he judges finished, and a new
message clears the mark. A marked thread says *Looks done* on its row and is never moved or archived by itself: a line
at the top of the list says *2 chats look done* with *Review*, which opens *Select* with those already ticked, so one
tap archives them, and unticking keeps any of them. A thread that finishes or is archived elsewhere while ticked leaves
the count and is not archived. When some can't be archived those threads go back and one copyable problem names each of
them and why; a single thread reads as it always did. A failed *Undo* of several says the same.

**A thread.** Bubbles: Igor's on the right, Larry's on the left, oldest at the top, opening at the newest. Images
show inline, tap to see full size; the full-size view always has a Done that shows on any picture, white or
dark, and a swipe down closes it too. A picture sent from a whiteboard also shows **Jump to board** in the full-size
view (#603, Igor, 2026-11-02: *"we opened a Zoom in and we get a button that says jump to the thing"*): it opens that
board as it is now, not the old picture, leaving the thread behind as any link does, with no full-size view left over
it. iCloud is asked first on every jump, so newer ink from another device is there when the board opens; out of
iCloud's reach, it opens the last drawing this device knew of. A board that was deleted, that isn't on this device even
after asking iCloud, or whose latest drawing didn't come down, says so in a copyable problem and the picture stays open. A picture from anywhere else has no button. Links are tappable. Under each of Igor's messages, its state: **Not sent yet**,
sent, 👀 when the Cockpit has received it, 🫡 when it is with Larry, 🏆 when the thing is done (with Larry's note),
the same ladder as the Cockpit's web page (Igor, 2026-11-03, #630: *"Look at how we do Telegram. Copy that for
everyone."*). A state this build doesn't know reads as 👀. Opening a thread marks it read here and on the laptop. The thread updates by itself every few seconds while it is open, and the list on each return to
it.

**Press and hold a message** (Igor, 2026-11-03, #629: *"Maybe let me do press-and-hold reactions for yes, no, quote in
reply"*). Holding one of Larry's messages opens a menu: *Yes*, *No*, *Quote in reply*, *Copy*. Holding one of Igor's own
offers *Quote in reply* and *Copy*, since answering himself means nothing. A message that is only a picture has nothing
to quote or copy, so Larry's offers *Yes* and *No* and Igor's opens no menu. Tapping a link or a picture works as ever. The menu's *Copy* takes the
whole message and replaces selecting its text by a long press, which the same gesture can't also do.

- **Yes and No** send at once, with no second tap: an ordinary message reading *Yes* or *No*, in the thread, under every
  rule a typed message has. It shows **Not sent yet** until the Cockpit has it, waits out no network, lands once and wakes
  Larry. The Cockpit has no reactions of its own, so there is no mark on the message Igor held. Whatever is in the bar
  stays there.
- **An older message.** A bare *Yes* answers whatever was said last, so when the held message isn't the thread's newest,
  the *Yes* or *No* goes under a quote of what it answers (*A picture* for a picture alone). Larry never reads it as an
  answer to something else.
- **Quote in reply** sends nothing. The message's words go into the bar, each line marked `> ` and at most 280 characters
  (cut with …), with a blank line after for the reply and the keyboard up. They follow anything already written, so
  quoting two messages keeps both. Igor edits and sends it as any message. A recording going on stops first, its words so
  far staying in the bar, as a Send mid-recording does. The quote is plain text in the message: the laptop's page and
  Larry read the same words.
- **A failure.** A *Yes* or *No* that can't be kept on the phone says so in a copyable problem at the top of the thread,
  with the thread and the message it answered, and nothing is sent.

**Links in a thread** (Igor, 2026-11-06, #736: *"If there's a PR or a blog link … It would be nice to get that extracted
and ready to go so I can just quickly click on it"*; he picked option A of three, the wide thread list with it, and C
later). An open thread collects every pull request, gist and web link its messages hold, Igor's and Larry's, into one
strip of chips under the thread's title, so the PR Larry opened an hour ago is one tap away instead of a scroll back.

- **What counts.** A link written out in full, starting `http://` or `https://`, in any message's words. A bare name
  that only looks like a site (*AGENTS.md*, *idvork.in/foo* with no `https://`) is not collected, though it stays
  tappable in its bubble as today. Punctuation that ends the sentence or wraps the link (a full stop, a comma, a
  closing bracket with no opening one, quotes, backticks, a bold mark's stars) is not part of the link.
- **How a chip reads.** A GitHub pull request reads *PR #734*, whichever of its pages the link was to (its files, a
  comment). A gist reads *gist*. Any other link reads its site, with no *www.*, and the last part of its path:
  *idvork.in/ai-journal*; when that last part is only a number, the part before it too (*github.com/issues/736*); a
  site's front page is the site alone. A long path is cut short with an ellipsis.
- **Order and repeats.** Newest message first, links within one message in the order they were written. A link that
  appears again (the same page, with or without a trailing slash, *www.* or a fragment; the same pull request from any
  of its pages) is one chip, where it was newest, and opens the newest one written.
- **At most ten.** The strip shows the ten newest; past ten it ends with *All links (N)*, which opens a list of every
  link in the thread in the same order, each with its chip's words and the link in full, tap to open.
- **Tap opens it** where iOS opens that link, leaving the thread as any link does.
- **Folding.** The strip starts with a *Links* control. Tapping it folds the chips away, leaving *Links (N)* alone on
  the line; tapping again unfolds them. Each thread remembers whether it is folded, across leaving it and across
  launches; a thread never folded shows its chips.
- **No links, no strip.** A thread with none shows nothing extra; the strip appears as soon as a message with a link
  arrives, and a new chat gains it once its first message with a link is on the Cockpit.
- **Links in the bubbles stay tappable** as they are; press and hold on a bubble works as ever.
- **Short links in a bubble** (Igor, 2026-11-10: *"if it's just a single PR, might as well just say PR. Same with
  Preview on idvorkin"*; *"Your PR chips are already perfect"*, so the chips do not change). Inside a message's own
  words, a pull request link reads *PR* when it is the only pull request that message links (the same PR written
  twice, or to two of its pages, is still one); when the message links several, each reads its chip's words,
  *PR #734*, and two with the same number from different repositories read the repository too
  (*context-grabber PR #734*). A link to Igor's blog — *idvork.in*, *idvorkin.github.io*, or a preview of it on the
  tailnet (the Cockpit's host on a port from 8400 to 8499) — reads *Preview*, or *Preview: ai-journal* (the last part
  of its path, as its chip has it) when the message links more than one such page. Every other link shows as written.
  The short word is the link: tapping it opens the full address; punctuation after it stays as written; *Copy* copies
  the message as written, full addresses included.

**Links in the thread list on an iPad or a Mac** (#736). Where the screen is wide — an iPad in full width (or a wide
enough window) and the Mac — each row in the list also shows that thread's three newest link chips under its last
line, read and labelled as in the thread, each tappable straight from the list without opening the thread. Tapping
the rest of the row opens the thread as before. A thread whose links have not been read on this device yet shows its
chips once its messages are read; that happens for the rows on screen and again only when a thread has something new,
so the list never reads every thread on each refresh. A row with no links, a row whose messages could not be read, and
every row offline or with no Cockpit address look as they do today, with no chips and no problem shown. An iPhone's
list, and an iPad in a narrow split, are unchanged.

**A pull request's state** (option C of #736, Igor chose *"A then C"*, 2026-11-06). A PR chip also says where that
pull request stands, as the Cockpit tracks it, without opening GitHub: in the thread's strip, in *All links*, and in
the wide thread list's rows.

- **The words and colours.** After its number the chip reads one word, its icon and word in that state's colour:
  *open* in green, *draft* in grey, *merged* in purple, *closed* in red (closed without merging). A VoiceOver reading
  of the chip says the number and the word.
- **Unknown reads as today.** A PR the Cockpit hasn't reported yet — just named, so its state is still being looked
  up — shows its number alone, and gains its word within the next check. Gists and web links never carry a word.
- **It stays current while it is on screen.** While a thread with PR chips is open, or a wide list showing PR chips
  is on screen, the app asks the Cockpit again about every half minute (and sooner, a few seconds after a check that
  left a PR still being looked up), so a PR merged on the laptop flips to *merged* without leaving or pulling to
  refresh. Off screen it asks nothing.
- **Never an error wall.** Offline, with no Cockpit address, or when the Cockpit can't answer, the chips look as they
  did: a chip whose state was never learned shows its number alone, and one already learned keeps its word until the
  next answer. No problem is shown for it; the failure is written to the session log, once until a check succeeds
  again.

**Writing.** One bar at the bottom: a growing text field with the keyboard's dictation mic, a paperclip for a file, a
*Paste image* control when the clipboard holds an image (preview, remove), and *Send*. Send needs text, an image or a
file. A sent message appears
at once with **Not sent yet** until the Cockpit has it, and the bar empties at once, text and attachment, with the keyboard
still up for the next message — typed or dictated alike (#449).

**Sending from a Mac's keyboard** (Igor, 2026-11-05, #683: *"Either Command+Enter or Enter should work in all the dialogues
to hit send."*). On the Mac, Enter sends and Command+Enter sends. Shift+Enter starts a new line, for a longer message. Both
send only what Send itself would: with nothing to send, or with the thread still waiting to exist, a key does nothing and
the words stay. A phone and an iPad keep the keyboard they have, where Return starts a new line.

**Bigger and smaller text on a Mac** (Igor, 2026-11-07, #781: *"Chat window should support font bigger smaller"*). On
the Mac, the View menu has *Bigger Text* (Command+=), *Smaller Text* (Command+Minus) and *Actual Size*
(Command+0). They change the size of everything in chat, the thread list and an open thread alike, in every window chat
shows in, one step at a time through the system's text sizes, from the smallest to the largest accessibility size. At
either end the key does nothing more and its item is dimmed. The size is remembered on this Mac across relaunches.
Nothing else in the app changes size. A phone and an iPad show no new items and follow the system's text size as before.

**Pasting a picture on a Mac** (Igor, 2026-11-06, #730: *"Should be able to paste photo into chat box on context
grabber"*). On the Mac, a picture copied in any app (Photos, Preview, a browser, a screenshot) pastes into the bar with
Command+V or Edit > Paste while the cursor is in the bar's field. It sits above the field with its preview and *Remove
image*, as *Paste image* puts it there, and the words already typed stay. When the clipboard also holds words, the key
pastes the words, as any text field does; *Paste image* takes the picture either way. *Paste image* is live whenever the
clipboard holds a picture, checked again each time Igor comes back to the window from another app, so a photo copied
elsewhere is one click or one key away. A phone and an iPad paste as they always have.

**Attaching a file** (Igor, 2026-11-03, #633: *"Support file and PDF upload"*). A paperclip on the bar opens the phone's
file picker, for a PDF or any other document. The file sits above the field by name and size, with *Remove file*, and goes
with whatever is typed as one message, which reads as the file's name and then the words; a new chat's title is the
words' first line, else the file's name. One attachment to a message: picking a file replaces a pasted image, and
pasting an image replaces a picked file. A picture chosen in the picker is treated as a pasted one: it previews and
sends as a picture, except that one over 10 MB is refused at the pick where a pasted one is made to fit. Send works
with a file alone. It waits on the phone and lands once like any message.

Limits are said when the file is picked, in a copyable problem, and the draft stays as it was: over 10 MB (the Cockpit's
limit), empty, or unreadable. Nothing is sent and the original file is untouched.

**A file the Cockpit won't take.** The Cockpit can hold only pictures so far. A file it refuses stays on the phone in
the thread (or under *Not sent yet* for a new chat), and a copyable problem names the file and gives the Cockpit's own
reason, with *Send again* beside it. *Send again* tries the same message once more, so once the Cockpit takes files
nothing needs picking again. A file stays until it is delivered or Igor deletes it. In a new chat whose first message
is a refused file, the bar says the file stays under *Not sent yet* and that a new message starts a separate chat
without it. If the phone can no longer read the kept file, the problem says that instead and offers no *Send again*:
no request went, and picking it again is the only way on.

**A new chat** (#536). Igor, 2026-10-26: *"for the Plus, why don't we just make that a new chat versus having its own
input dialog? That's probably a better UI."* The **+** opens an empty thread titled *New chat*, with the same bar every
thread has — text, the paperclip, *Paste image*, the mic — and the keyboard up. There is no separate sheet. Back with nothing sent
leaves no thread behind. The first Send starts the thread: the message shows at once as **Not sent yet**, kept on the
phone and sent by the same rules as any message (so it waits out no network), and the thread's title becomes that
message's first line. Once the Cockpit has it, the same screen is that thread, live like any other, and the bar takes
the next message. Until then the bar holds the next message back and says it goes once the first reaches Larry; a
not-yet-sent new thread also shows in the list under *Not sent yet*, as now. If Larry refuses that first message, it
says why, copyably, as any refused message does, and the bar takes a new first message at once — a line under the bar
says the first was refused — which starts the chat afresh (a refused file stays, and the line says so: *A file the
Cockpit won't take*); deleting the waiting first message does the same. Each
attempt is its own message, so a new try is never mistaken for the refused or deleted one, and the screen follows
the newest.

**A new chat by voice** (#637). Igor, 2026-11-03: a voice button beside the **+**, for a first message that is spoken.
It sits immediately to the left of the **+**, the same size, so the **+** stays where the thumb knows it. A tap opens a
new chat just as the **+** does — an empty thread titled *New chat*, the same bar, no sheet or dialog — and starts
recording straight away with the chat mic described below, as if he had tapped that mic himself. Everything about the
recording is the chat mic's: the red button and the seconds, the words in the field as he speaks, a tap to stop, the
five-minute stop. Nothing is sent until he taps Send, and that Send starts the thread as any first Send does. Going back
stops the recording and leaves no thread behind. The keyboard stays down while it records, since he is talking and the
words fill the field by themselves; a tap on the field brings it up. The **+** itself is unchanged: keyboard up,
nothing recording.

A live call still holds the microphone. During a call the voice button is dimmed, and a tap opens the new chat with the
keyboard up, records nothing, and the bar says the call has the mic, as the thread's own mic does. A permission that is
off, or a recognizer that will not start, shows its copyable line in the new chat's bar, and the new chat stays open to
type in or to try the mic again. An older copyable line from the mic never hides these quieter lines: both show.

**Speaking a message** (#448). Igor, 2026-10-26, first: *"transcription based, use a good model like we do in
cockpit"*; then, on learning the problem reports' dictation is Apple's own recognizer: *"All right, use that."* So the
chat mic is the same dictation the problem report's note uses — Apple's speech recognizer, on the phone when it can
be, no key and no service of ours. The bar has a mic button right beside *Send*, at the bar's trailing edge after the
field, each at least a finger tall and wide (Igor, 2026-11-03, #625: *"put the record button by the send button"*).
Tap it to start; it turns red and shows the seconds counting; tap it again to stop. The words appear **in the field as Igor speaks**, after what was in it
when he tapped — never sent. When he stops, the last words settle (a spinner while they do), and he reads them, fixes
what he likes, and taps Send. A recording where nothing was heard leaves the field as it was. Nothing is kept of the
sound.

A problem report opened during a recording (#559) leaves the recording running: the phone can't run two recognizers at
once, and the first one would die with an error and lose its place. The report's own mic is off while the chat holds
the microphone, as it is during a call; Igor can type the report, or stop the recording and then speak it. If the
recording ends with the report still open, the report's mic comes back at his next keystroke.

- **Which microphone.** Igor, 2026-10-26: *"make sure to be able to have a mic selector and then see the audio input
  levels."* A row across the bar, above the field, names the microphone the next recording will use —
  *Microphone · Automatic* (whatever the phone routes) or one of the phone's inputs (the built-in mic, a headset,
  AirPods) — laid out as the problem report's microphone row is. The whole row is the target, a full finger tall
  (Igor, 2026-10-26, #544: *"the selector button for the microphone is too small"*); a tap opens the list, with *Find
  microphones* to list them. The pick is kept across launches and is the same one the problem report's dictation uses. It cannot be
  changed while recording or during a live call. Under the row a thin live input-level bar shows how loud the
  microphone hears Igor while he records — green, orange near the top where the voice would clip, empty when not
  recording — the same meter the problem report shows (#531, Igor 2026-10-26: *"Don't forget to give me a
  Microphone box on this input as well … I really like the way it's done for Bug kit"*).
- **Permissions.** The first tap asks for speech recognition and the microphone (the same ones the problem report's
  dictation uses). Declined, a copyable line above the bar says which is off and that the phone's Settings turns it
  back on.
- **A live call.** While a call with Larry is live, the mic is the call's: the button is dimmed and a tap says so,
  starting nothing. A call that starts mid-recording stops it at once; the words already in the field stay, and a
  line says the call took the microphone.
- **An interruption.** A phone call, Siri or the microphone changing mid-recording stops it; the words heard so far
  stay in the field (still never sent), and a copyable line says the microphone was interrupted.
- **Five minutes at most.** Igor, 2026-10-26: a recording is capped at 5 minutes. At 5:00 it stops on its own and
  the words settle into the field exactly as if Igor had tapped stop — still never sent — and a quiet line under that
  thread's bar says *Stopped at 5 minutes.*
- **Music.** Recording mixes with whatever is playing, as the problem report's dictation does; it is not paused.
- **Failures** (the recognizer stopping, a microphone that will not start) are copyable errors above the bar; the
  words already in the field stay. A Gym Timer cue during a recording takes the audio session and stops it the same
  way: the words so far stay in the field.
- **Leaving the thread** mid-recording stops it.
- **Sending mid-recording** (#546, Igor 2026-10-26: *"Even after the send we still have the element in the sandbox"*):
  Send sends what is in the field — the words heard so far — and stops the recording there. Nothing comes back into
  the emptied bar afterwards; the bar is ready for the next message, and the mic for the next recording.

**Sharing in.** The share card keeps its preview and an optional field headed *Message* (#673, Igor 2026-11-04: it
lands as a chat message, so it is not called a note), and *Add to Inbox* becomes *Start a chat*. A
share with *New chat* ticked becomes a new thread whose first message is the shared thing with his message. The title
is the first line of what he wrote, else the text's, else the link's site, else *Photo, <date>*. It works in aeroplane
mode and while the app is not running, as now.

**The shared link on the message** (#673, Igor 2026-11-04: *"check that the shared link comes through"*). A share that
holds a web link becomes a message that starts with the whole link, exactly as shared, query and fragment included,
then what he wrote. That holds for a new chat and a chat picked from the list, with words or without, while it waits
on the phone and once it has gone.

- However the other app hands the link over, it is found: as a link, as a link's plain words, as marked-up text (RTF,
  HTML) whose words are the link, or behind another attachment that is not a web link, such as a file, an email address
  or another text. Text that is nothing but a link is a link.
- Text with a link somewhere inside it stays text and goes word for word, the link where it was.
- A web link beats anything else shared with it, a picture included. An address that is not a web link, such as an
  email address, is the shared link only when no web link came with it. A picture or text shared with no web link has
  no link to carry: iOS does not tell the card what page it came from.
- A title the other app offers beside a link shows on the card and does not go in the message.

**Speaking on the card** (#673; #793, Igor 2026-11-09: *"Share sheet should have a microphone button just like we
have in bug kit"*). The *Message* field has a mic button at its trailing edge, the one the problem report's note has,
and it is the same dictation: Apple's speech recognizer, on the phone when it can be.

- **A tap starts it.** The button turns into a red stop button while it listens, and the words appear in the *Message*
  field as he speaks, after anything already typed there. A second tap stops it and the last words settle. A quiet
  line under the field says when voice input is starting or finishing.
- **No typing while it listens.** The field is dimmed and takes no typing from the tap until the last words
  have settled: each new word rewrites the field from what was there at the tap, so anything typed meanwhile would
  be lost. Stop, then edit.
- **Nothing is sent by speaking.** The words only fill the field; the share goes when he taps *Start a chat* or *Send*.
- **Sending mid-recording** sends what is in the field, the words heard so far, and stops the recording, as a Send
  from a thread's bar does (#546). *Cancel*, or swiping the card away, stops it and keeps nothing.
- **Permissions.** The first tap asks for speech recognition and the microphone, the two the chat mic asks for.
  Declined, a copyable line under the field says which is off and that the phone's Settings turns it on.
- **Failures** (a permission off, the recognizer stopping, a microphone that will not start, an interruption) are a
  copyable line under the field, and the copy carries where it stopped and what the phone says of both permissions.
  The words heard so far stay in the field, and typing still works.
- **Smaller than the chat mic.** The card has no microphone picker, no input level and no five-minute limit: it
  listens on whichever microphone the phone routes, until he stops it or the card closes.
- **Not yet known.** Apple's guidance is that an app extension, which is what the card is, cannot use the microphone
  (an iMessage app excepted). The button is there so the phone can answer: if iOS refuses, the tap ends in the
  copyable line above, and that copy is the evidence for what to do next. The card also cannot tell that a call with
  Larry is live in the app; what a tap does to that call is still to be seen on the phone. The keyboard's own
  dictation key works in the *Message* field as in any other field, whatever the button does.

**Sharing into a chat that is already going** (#587, Igor 2026-11-01: *"let's allow me to select some of the previous
chats as well"*). Under the message field the card lists *New chat*, ticked, and the five most recent chats that are still
live, each with its title and how long ago it last moved: the always-on chat first, then newest activity. Done and
archived chats are not offered. Tapping a row ticks it, and the card's button reads *Start a chat* for *New chat* and
*Send* for a chat. The shared thing, with his message, becomes the next message in that chat, under the same rules as any
message from the thread's bar: it waits on the phone, goes once, and shows in the thread as *Not sent yet* until it has
gone. Sharing still never waits on the network:

- The card opens at once with *New chat* ticked and can be sent straight away; the recent chats are asked of the
  Cockpit as it opens, and appear when they come. Their arrival never moves the tick. This one question is the only
  thing the card asks the network; the shared thing itself is written to the phone and sent by the app, as before.
- With the Cockpit out of reach, or answering with something else, within a few seconds the card offers *New chat*
  alone and one quiet line says why, selectable and with *Copy*. In aeroplane mode this is how a share looks.
- A chat with nothing to offer (a new install, every chat Done) is *New chat* alone, with no line.
- A share into a chat the Cockpit no longer has is refused like any other: it is not resent, and it reads *Larry refused
  it* with the Cockpit's reason. A message into a chat the list does not hold stays visible in the list under *Not sent
  yet*, refused or waiting, with a swipe to delete, since no thread on screen could show it.

**The chat this link already started** (#794, Igor 2026-11-09: *"share sheet can find a thread that started with a
matching URL and the last I don't know four or eight hours — that should be recommended thread to append to"*). He
shares a link, Larry answers, and an hour later he shares the same page again with a second thought: that belongs in
the chat the first share started, not in a twin of it. So when the link on the card is one that started a chat within
the last **eight hours**, and that chat is still live, the card recommends it: it is the first row under *New chat*,
above the always-on chat, with *Same link* under its title. The chats appear with it already in place: no row moves once the list is
shown. It takes one of the five places, so the card still lists
at most five chats, and it is listed even when it is not among the five most recent.

- **Recommended, not chosen.** *New chat* is still ticked when the card opens and the button still reads *Start a
  chat*; one tap on the recommended row ticks it. The list arrives after the card opens, and a tick that moved on its
  own under his thumb would send a share somewhere he did not choose (the rule above).
- **Eight hours, counted from when the chat started** (when the Cockpit took the first share, which is what Larry's
  answer follows, not when the card was sent). He offered four or eight. Eight covers one sitting with a subject, a
  morning's link picked up again in the afternoon, where four would lose it over lunch and a meeting. Past that the same
  link is more likely a fresh look that deserves its own chat, and the cost of being generous is small: a
  recommendation is one row he can ignore, and it only appears for the very page he is sharing.
- **The same link** means the same page, however the other app dressed the address. Ignored: `http` against `https`,
  capitals in the site's name, a leading `www.`, a trailing slash, a `#` that names a place on the page, the order of what
  follows the `?`, and the tags that only track where a click came from (`utm_…`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `igshid` and
  their kind, and `si` on YouTube and Spotify, where it marks who shared; elsewhere `si` may be the page). Everything
  else counts: another path is another page, and so is another `?v=` or `?id=`, and so is a `#` that begins with `/`
  or `!`, which on some sites is the page's address. Two addresses a site
  treats as one page (a short link and its long form, a mobile site) are not matched.
- **Only a share that started a chat counts**: a link shared with *New chat* ticked, once the app has sent it and the
  chat exists. A link sent into a chat already going does not make that chat the link's, and neither does a link typed
  into a message. A first share still waiting on the phone has started nothing yet, so a second share of it is offered
  *New chat* and the recent chats as usual.
- **Several chats started from the same link** in the window: the most recently started one that is still live is
  recommended, and only that one is marked.
- **Nothing to recommend** — a link shared for the first time, one whose chat is older than eight hours, Done,
  archived or gone from the Cockpit, some text or a picture, or the list out of reach — and the card is exactly as
  above, with no line saying so.
- The phone remembers which chat each shared link started for those eight hours and no longer (the card never
  reads an older one, and the app drops them when it next comes to the front), apart from the message itself, which is still dropped once the thread shows it (*What the phone keeps*). The app's log says that a share
  was offered a same-link chat and whether it went there, never the address.

**Sending.** The same rules the Inbox has: tried when the app opens or comes to the front, when the network returns
and after a failed send's network change, oldest first, never while offline. A message resent after a lost answer
appears once on the thread, and a share resent after a lost answer makes one thread, not two. A message the Cockpit
refuses (too big, an unreadable image) reads *Larry refused it* with the reason, copyable, and is not resent on its own
(only a file offers *Send again*, above); a swipe deletes it. Unreachable keeps it **Not sent yet**.

**When the Cockpit isn't answering** (#565, 2026-10-27: the Cockpit's host was off the tailnet and Igor read the
timeout as *"Context grabber inbox broke"*). A request that times out or cannot connect while the phone itself is
online means the Cockpit is away, not the phone or the app. The list and an open thread then say *The Cockpit isn't
answering — your messages are kept and go when it does*, still copyable, with the underlying reason alongside; a
waiting message reads *Not sent yet · the Cockpit isn't answering*. This is distinct from the *No network* line, which
is the phone being offline. Other failures (the Cockpit answering with an error) keep their plain reason.

While the app is open and a message waits after a send that did not get through (the Cockpit away, or answering
with a server error), it is tried again on its own: after 30 seconds,
then a minute, two, four, and every five minutes after that. The wait starts over after a send that gets through, and
the retries stop once nothing waits or the phone goes offline (the network's return sends it, as above). A refused
message is never retried on its own.

**Hearing back.** iOS runs a background check now and then — it decides when, so a reply may wait minutes or hours.
When the check finds a reply Igor has not seen, one notification per thread: *Larry* and the thread's title, with the
reply's first line. Tapping it opens that thread. A reply already read on the laptop raises nothing, nor does a
thread marked Done. The very first check after install only takes note of what is already there, so weeks of
unread laptop threads do not arrive as a burst; only replies after it notify. Notifications
need Igor's permission, asked once, the first time he sends a message; declining leaves everything else working.

**What was in the Inbox.** Items still waiting when this ships each become a new thread, as a share would. Items
already sent to Larry's inbox stay readable under one *Earlier shares* row at the bottom of the list, read-only, and
can be swiped away.

**What the phone keeps.** A message stays on the phone until the Cockpit's thread shows it; once Igor sees it there,
in an open thread, the phone's copy (and its picture) is dropped, so the phone does not fill up with old chat.

**On a simulator (#525).** A simulator reaches the tailnet too, so like the stats archive it talks to the real Cockpit
only when a launch hook names an address, and a hook can name a stand-in or the real one. Without one, chat, the Inbox, the
whiteboard's turns and the share card reach no Cockpit at all: nothing is sent, read or marked read. What waits in the outbox stays
waiting, however it got there, and goes when a later launch names an address. The chat list and an open thread say
copyably that this simulator has no address and how to give it one, rather than reading as a Cockpit that is away, and
nothing is tried again on a timer. A phone or an iPad behaves as it always has. A Mac build reaches Igor's Cockpit as
his phone does, unless a launch names another address or nowhere, and such a launch keeps its own outbox, so what it
leaves waiting never goes to Larry ([#680](2026-11-03-native-mac-app-design.md)).

## Explaining itself

- `inbox` added says whether a share starts a chat or names its thread, and what the card's list held when Igor sent
  it (how many chats, still reading, or why it failed): the card itself cannot write to the session log.
- `chat` events in the session log: sent / refused / failed (thread, message id, the Cockpit's answer; never the
  text; a new thread's sent line names where it landed), offline_skipped and network_back as the Inbox logs them,
  refreshed (count of unread), and background_check (when iOS ran it, what it found, notifications raised).
- `chat` reply_failed (thread, message id, the skill; once per failure on screen, never the text); opening a thread
  names its skill.
- `chat_voice` events: record_start (thread), record_stop (thread, seconds), capped (at the five-minute limit),
  dropped (left the thread, a call started, a quote), refused (a live call). The dictation's own `dictation_start`,
  `dictation_stop` and `dictation_error` lines (the problem report's) carry the recognizer's side. Never the words.
- `chat` no_address, once at each launch of a simulator with no address, says why chat reaches nothing; `inbox` no_address
  (how many wait, what asked) at each send it held back; a refresh that could not run says the same in its reason.
- `chat` image_pasted says how a picture came in (the button or the Mac's paste) and its bytes; a clipboard picture that
  could not be read logs the same line with what the clipboard held instead.
- `chat` events for the press-and-hold menu: reaction (yes or no, thread, message id, whether it was the newest), quote
  and copy (thread, message id). A Yes or No the phone could not keep logs an error with the same fields and the
  reason. Never the text.
- `chat` link_opened (thread, where it was tapped: the strip, *All links* or the list, and the chip's kind: pr, gist or
  web; never the link), links_folded (thread, folded or not), and links_read_failed (thread, why) once per thread when
  a wide list could not read a row's links.
- A thread that cannot be read logs one error when the problem starts or changes, not one per poll.
- Every error on screen is copyable, with the thread and the Cockpit's answer.

## Acceptance criteria

- The tile reads *Chat* and counts unread conversations plus unsent messages.
- The list shows every Cockpit chat thread, Done folded the same as the Cockpit; opening one marks it read on both.
- A message typed or dictated in a thread appears at once, reads **Not sent yet** offline, and reaches the Cockpit
  once when the network returns; Larry's reply appears in the open thread within seconds without a manual refresh.
- Sharing a Safari link, a Notes text and a Photos image makes three new threads with sensible titles, in aeroplane
  mode too, each delivered once.
- The share card's field is headed *Message*. A Safari link shared with or without words, to a new chat or a picked
  one, arrives with the whole link first and his words after it.
- 👀 appears under Igor's message once the Cockpit has it, 🫡 once it is with Larry, 🏆 once Larry marks it done.
- With the app closed, a reply from Larry eventually raises one notification for its thread; tapping it opens the
  thread; a reply already read elsewhere, or in a Done thread, raises none; the first check after install raises
  none.
- A refused message says why, copyably, and is never resent on its own; only a file offers *Send again*.
- Holding Larry's newest message and tapping *Yes* sends *Yes*; on an older one it sends a quote of that message, then
  *Yes*; *No* the same. *Quote in reply* fills the bar, sends nothing and leaves what was typed in place. Igor's own
  messages offer no *Yes* or *No*.
- The picker lists the phone's microphones and the next recording uses the one picked; *Automatic* follows the
  phone's route.
- Tap the mic, speak, tap again: the words appear in the field as they are spoken, after what was typed, and nothing
  is sent until Send; nothing heard leaves the field unchanged. During a live call the mic is dimmed and says why; a
  failure is a copyable error and the words already in the field stay. At 5:00 a recording stops on its own, its
  words in the field, with *Stopped at 5 minutes.* under the bar.
- The + opens an empty *New chat* thread with the ordinary bar (text, paperclip, Paste image, mic); its first Send starts
  the thread, which becomes the live thread once the Cockpit has it; leaving before sending leaves nothing. A refused or
  deleted first message lets the next Send start the chat afresh, as a new message that reaches Larry.
- The voice button beside the + opens the same empty *New chat* thread already recording, the keyboard down; the words
  land in the field, nothing is sent until Send, and that Send starts the thread; back leaves nothing. During a live
  call it is dimmed, and a tap opens the new chat recording nothing, with the keyboard up and a line saying the call has
  the mic. The + still opens with the keyboard up and records nothing.
- Waiting Inbox items become threads on first launch; sent ones stay under *Earlier shares*.
- On the Mac, Command+= makes chat's text one size bigger and Command+Minus one smaller, Command+0 puts it back, the
  size is the same after a relaunch, and nothing outside chat changes size.
- On the Mac, a picture copied in another app makes *Paste image* live on coming back to the window, and Command+V or
  Edit > Paste in the bar's field attaches it with its preview, the typed words kept. Words on the clipboard still
  paste as words. A phone and an iPad are unchanged.
- The paperclip picks a PDF or any document; it shows by name and size, *Remove file* takes it off, and Send sends it with
  or without words. A picture picked there goes as a picture. Over 10 MB, empty or unreadable says so copyably at the
  pick and leaves the draft alone.
- A file the Cockpit refuses is still on the phone, with a copyable problem naming it and the Cockpit's reason; *Send
  again* retries the same message, and delivers it once the Cockpit takes files. A kept file the phone can't read says
  so and has no *Send again*.
- A new chat that began with a refused file says where the file stays and that a new message starts a separate chat.
- The share card lists *New chat* (ticked) and up to five recent live chats, with title and age, as soon as the Cockpit
  answers; a share into one lands as that chat's next message, once, with no new thread and no new title; with the
  Cockpit out of reach the card offers *New chat* alone, says why, and still closes at once on sending.
- A simulator launched with no address sends nothing to the Cockpit, whatever its outbox holds, reads nothing from it,
  and says why in the log and on the list; the same outbox goes once, to the address a later launch names. A phone or an
  iPad with no address talks to the Cockpit as before.
- A skill's thread sits under Larry's pinned thread whichever is newer, can't be archived, and its replies carry the
  skill's name and avatar. A failure is a copyable error and leaves Igor's message without 🏆. An older Cockpit shows
  none of this.
- An open thread with links shows them as chips under its title, newest first, one chip per page: a pull request as
  *PR #N*, a gist as *gist*, anything else as its site and the last part of its path; a tap opens it. Only links
  written with `https://` (or `http://`) count, and the sentence's punctuation is not part of them.
- Past ten links the strip ends with *All links (N)*, listing every one in the same order, each tappable.
- *Links* folds the chips away and unfolds them; the thread remembers which, after leaving it and after a relaunch.
  A thread with no links has no strip.
- On the Mac and a full-width iPad, each row of the thread list shows that thread's three newest link chips, each
  tappable from the list; a row without links looks as it does today, and an iPhone's list is unchanged.
- A PR chip reads *open*, *draft*, *merged* or *closed* after its number, in green, grey, purple or red, in the strip,
  *All links* and a wide list's rows; a PR the Cockpit hasn't reported reads as before. Merging a PR while its thread
  is open flips its chip to *merged* within about half a minute. Offline or with the Cockpit down, no problem shows.

## Depends on the Cockpit

Two small changes there (a PR to idvorkin-ai-tools/cockpit), before the phone half:

- Messages from the phone are recognised as the phone's, alongside the page, the command line and Telegram.
- A message or new thread resent with the same id is recognised as one already taken, as Larry's inbox does today.

Files (#633) need one more, not built yet; until then a file is refused and kept, as above:

- The Cockpit's attachments accept PDFs and other documents, not only pictures, under the same 10 MB limit and the same
  rule that it names what it stores; a message can name one, Larry is told where it is, and asking for it returns it.
  The file's own name reaches Larry in the message's words. The Cockpit's web page shows such an attachment as something
  to open, not as a broken picture.

Showing a delivered file in the phone's thread, as a row that opens it, is built with that change; no Cockpit sends one
back today.

A pull request's state (#736, option C) needs nothing new: the Cockpit already tracks pull requests for its own
summaries and answers, for any list of them the app names, each one's state and whether it is a draft; one it wasn't
tracking yet is looked up within seconds of being named. It can also push changes as they happen; the app asks again
every half minute instead, for now.
