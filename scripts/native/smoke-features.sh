# Igor, 2026-11-01: "if only touched 1 feature don't re-run ALL test". Prints the simulator smoke's sections a change
# touches, comma-separated, for SMOKE_ONLY: "all" when it touches shared code or the smoke itself (or the base is
# unknown), "none" when it touches no feature the smoke drives (the launch and report checks still run). The change is everything on this
# branch since origin/main, committed or not.
# Usage: smoke-features.sh [base]   (default origin/main)
