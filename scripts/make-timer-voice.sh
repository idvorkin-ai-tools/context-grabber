# Render one of the native Gym Timer's count voices (stories 182, 187) and put its
# cues in the app's bundle:
#
#   scripts/make-timer-voice.sh <name> <voice_id> <style>
#     → assets/audio/timer-voices/<name>-{three,two,one,go,rest,done}.wav
#
# The words are rendered by make-timer-words.sh (ElevenLabs, MODEL default
# eleven_v3, STABILITY default 0.5, STYLE = <style>: plain, firm or excited)
# and composed by make-timer-cues.mjs in a working directory outside the repo
# (WORK, default ~/tmp/agent/skill/timer-voice-<name>), so Igor's own set in
# assets/audio/timer — which the React Native app also plays — is untouched,
# and the keepalive stays his. It costs ElevenLabs credits: run it once per
# voice. A count word longer than a second can run into the next second's
# cue; re-render just that word with more takes and keep the shortest:
#
#   ONLY=one TAKES=4 scripts/make-timer-voice.sh aussie fZ7qV5MCpftIbraon8xo excited
#
# The voices today:
#   adam    pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB  firm     (the default)
#   aussie  fZ7qV5MCpftIbraon8xo  excited  (an Australian woman)
#   igor    — his clone; the plain set in assets/audio/timer (make-timer-words.sh)
# Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-swift-native-app-design.md (step 2)
